<h3 class='c001'>PREFACE.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The sale of copies of this book is now to be reckoned by
its tens of thousands! The last, the Seventh Edition, comprising
five thousand copies, has been rapidly exhausted; a
new Edition, <span class='sc'>the Eighth</span>, is now urgently called for; and as
the sale of the work is so enormous, and so extending, my
worthy Publishers have deemed it advisable to publish of this
edition at once seven thousand copies,—thus making of the
<i>two</i> last editions <i>alone</i> twelve thousand copies; the two last
editions being, in fact, equal to twelve ordinary editions!
Moreover, this book has made me troops of friends, thus
proving how much such a work was needed, and how thoroughly
my humble efforts have been appreciated.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have, in the <span class='sc'>Introductory Chapter</span> especially addressed
to a Young Wife, had some plain and unpalatable truths to
tell; but it is absolutely necessary for a surgeon to probe a
serious and deep-seated wound to the bottom before he can
perform a cure; he is sometimes compelled to give pain before
he can cure pain; he is frequently obliged to administer
<i>bitter</i> medicine before <i>sweet</i> health can be restored. I have
not shrunk from my duty; I have not uttered an “uncertain
sound:” but have, without fear or favor, boldly spoken out,
and have proclaimed what I have deemed to be the truth; the
vital importance of my subject must excuse my plain-speaking
and earnestness. When a person is on the edge of a
precipice, and is ready at any moment to topple over, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>words of warning must not be in the tones of a whisper, bland
and gentle, but in the voice of thunder, bold and decisive. I
have had to discourse on matters of the greatest moment to
the well-being of wives; and have, therefore, in order not to
be misapprehended, had to call things by their right names—the
subject being of far too much importance to write in a
namby-pamby style, or to use any other language than that
of the plainest English.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Introductory Chapter is, I trust, greatly improved;
many of the quotations are either curtailed, or are altogether
suppressed, in order to make room, without materially increasing
the size of the book, for much new and important
matter. The remaining pages have all been carefully revised
and corrected, and made more clear, and additional advice,
where needed, has been supplied. I therefore hope that this
edition will be still more worthy of its great and extending
success, and be the humble instrument of sowing broadcast
through our land advice most necessary for wives to know;
and at the same time be the means of dispelling prejudices
which, in the lying-in room, are even, in this our day, most
rife and injurious.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barren wives! delicate wives! unhealthy wives! are the
order of the day—are become institutions of the country—are
so common as not to be considered strange, but to be, as
a matter of course, as part and parcel of our everyday life!
Should such things be? I emphatically say No! But then
a thorough change, a complete reformation, must take place
in the life and habits of a wife. It is no use blinking the
question; the truth, the whole truth, must come out, and the
sooner it is told the better. Oh! it is sad that the glorious
mission of a wife should, as it often does, end so ingloriously!
Broken health, neglected duties, a childless home, blighted
hopes, misery, and discontent. What an awful catalogue of
the consequences of luxury, of stimulants, of fashion, of ignorance,
and of indolence—the five principal wife and babe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>destroyers! Sure I am that the foregoing melancholy results
may, in the generality of cases, by timely and judicious treatment,
be prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is an age of stimulants—’tis the curse of the day;
wine, in excess, instead of being an element of strength, is
one of weakness; instead of encouraging fecundity, is one of
its greatest preventives. A lady who drinks daily five or six
glasses of wine, is invariably weak, low, hysterical, and “nervous,”—complaining
that she can neither eat, nor sleep, nor
take exercise; she is totally unfit for the duties and responsibilities
of either wife or mother. I shall endeavor in the following
pages to prove the truth of these bold assertions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many young married ladies now drink as much wine in a
day as their grandmothers did in a week; and which I verily
believe is one cause of so few children, and of so much barrenness
among them. It is no use: the subject is too important
to allow false delicacy to stand in the way of this announcement;
the truth must be told; the ulcer which is eating
into the vitals of society must be probed; the danger, the
folly, the wickedness of the system must be laid bare; the
battle must be fought; and as no medical man has come forward
to begin the conflict, I myself boldly throw down the
gauntlet, and will, to the best of my strength and ability, do
battle in the cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the abuse and not the use of wine that I am contending
against. I am not advocating teetotal principles—certainly
not. The one system is as absurd and as wrong as the
other; extremes, either way, are most injurious to the constitution
both of man and woman. The advice of St. Paul
is glorious advice: “Use a <i>little</i> wine for thy stomach’s sake
and thine often infirmities;” and again, when he says, “be
temperate in <i>all</i> things.” These are my sentiments, and which
I have, in the following pages, so earnestly contended for.</p>

<p class='c008'>A lady who “eats without refreshment, and slumbers without
repose,” is deeply to be pitied, even though she be as rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>as Crœsus, or as beautiful as Venus! Nothing can compensate
for the want of either sleep or appetite; life without
proper appetite and without refreshing sleep will soon become
a wearisome burden too heavy to bear. It is high time, when
there are so many of the Young Wives of England, alas! too
many, who daily “eat without refreshment,” and who nightly
“slumber without repose,” that the subject was thoroughly
looked into, and that proper means were suggested to abate
the calamity. One of the principal objects of this book is
to throw light upon the subject, and to counsel measures to
remedy the evil.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large number of barren wives in England has, in these
pages, had my careful and earnest consideration. I have endeavored,
to the best of my ability, to point out, as far as the
wives themselves are concerned, many of the causes, and have
advised remedies to abate the same. It is quite time, when
the health among the wives of the higher classes is so much
below par, and when children among them are so few, that the
causes should be thoroughly inquired into, and that the treatment
should be extensively made known. The subject is of
immense, indeed I might even say, of national importance,
and demands deep and earnest thought and careful investigation,
as the strength and sinews of a nation depend mainly
upon the number and healthfulness of her children.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barren land can generally, with care and skill, be made fertile;
an unfruitful vine can frequently, by an experienced gardener,
be converted into a fruit-bearing one; a childless wife
can often, by judicious treatment, be made a child-bearing
one. Few things in this world are impossible: “where there
is a will there is generally a way;” but if there be a will, it
must be a determined and a persevering will; if there be a
way, the way, however rough and rugged, must be trodden,—the
rough and rugged path will, as she advances onward, become
smooth and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not the poor woman, who works hard and who lives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>hard, that is usually barren—certainly not: she has generally
an abundance of children; but it is the rich lady—the one
who is indolent, who lives luxuriously, and fares sumptuously
every day—who leads a fashionable, and therefore an unnatural
life—who turns night into day, who at night breathes
suffocatingly hot rooms, who lives in a whirl of excitement,
who retires not to rest until the small hours of the morning,—such
a one is the one that is frequently barren; and well she
might be,—it would be most strange if she were not so. One
of the objects of this book will be to point out these causes,
and to suggest remedies for the same, and thus to stem the
torrent, and in some measure to do away with the curse of
barrenness which in England, at the present time, so fearfully
prevails.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have undertaken a responsible task, but have thrown my
whole energy and ability into it; I therefore have no excuse
to make that I have not thought earnestly and well upon the
subject, or that I have written unadvisedly; my thoughts and
studies have for years been directed to these matters. I earnestly
hope, then, that I have not written in vain, but that the
seeds now sown will, in due time, bring forth much fruit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although my two books—<cite>Advice to a Wife</cite> and <cite>Advice
to a Mother</cite>—are published as separate works, they might, in
point of fact, be considered as one volume—one only being
the continuation of the other. <cite>Advice to a Wife</cite>, treating on
a mother’s own health, being, as it were, a preparation for
<cite>Advice to a Mother</cite> on the management of her children’s
health; it is quite necessary that the mother herself should
be healthy to have healthy children; and if she have healthy
offspring, it is equally important that she should be made
thoroughly acquainted how to keep them in health. The object
of <cite>Advice to a Wife</cite> and <cite>Advice to a Mother</cite> is for that
end; indeed, the acquisition and the preservation of sound
health, of mother and of child, have, in both my books, been
my earnest endeavor, my constant theme, the beginning and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>the ending, the sum and the substance of my discourse, on
which all else beside hinges.</p>

<p class='c008'>I again resign this book into the hands of my fair readers,
hoping that it may be of profit and of service to them during
the whole period of their wifehood; and especially during the
most interesting part of their lives—in their hour of anguish
and of trial; and that it may be the humble means of making
a barren woman “to be a joyful mother of children.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c007'>1. It may be well—before I enter on the subjects
of menstruation, of pregnancy, of labor, and suckling—to
offer a few preliminary observations, especially
addressed to a Young Wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. My subject is health—the care, the restoration,
and the preservation of health—one of the most glorious
subjects that can be brought before a human being,
and one that should engross much of our time and of
our attention, and one that cannot be secured unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>it be properly attended to. The human frame is, as
every one knows, constantly liable to be out of order;
it would be strange, indeed, if a beautiful and complex
instrument like the human body were not occasionally
out of tune:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Strange that a harp with a thousand strings</div>
      <div class='line'>Should keep in tune so long.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>3. The advice I am about to offer to my fair reader
is of the greatest importance, and demands her deepest
attention. How many wives are there with broken
health, with feeble constitutions, and with childless
homes! Their number is legion! It is painful to contemplate
that, in our country, there are far more unhealthy
than healthy wives! There must surely be
numerous causes for such a state of things! A woman,
born with every perfection, to be full of bodily infirmities!
It was ordained by the Almighty that wives
should be fruitful and multiply! Surely there must be
something wrong in the present system if they do not
do so!</p>

<p class='c008'>4. It will, in the following pages, be my object to
point out many of the causes of so much ill health
among wives; ill health that sometimes leads to barrenness;
and to suggest remedies both for the prevention
and for the cure of such causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. It is an astounding and lamentable fact, that one
out of eight—that twelve and a half per cent. of all the
wives of England are barren, are childless! A large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>majority of this twelve and a half per cent. might be
made fruitful, if a more judicious plan of procedure
than is at present pursued were adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. My anxious endeavors, in the following pages,
will be to point out remedies for the evil, and to lay
down rules—rules which, I hope, my fair reader will
strenuously follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. My theme, then, is Health—the Health of Wives—and
the object I shall constantly have in view will
be the best means both of preserving it and of restoring
it when lost. By making a wife strong, she will
not only, in the majority of cases, be made fruitful, but
capable of bringing <i>healthy</i> children into the world.
This latter inducement is of great importance; for
puny children are not only an anxiety to their parents,
but a misery to themselves, and a trouble to all around!
Besides, it is the children of England that are to be her
future men and women—her glory and her greatness!
How desirable it is, then, that her children should be
hardy and strong!</p>

<p class='c008'>8. A wife may be likened to a fruit tree, a child to
its fruit. We all know that it is as impossible to have
fine fruit from an unhealthy tree as to have a fine child
from an unhealthy mother. In the one case, the tree
either does not bear fruit at all—is barren—or it bears
undersized, tasteless fruit,—fruit which often either immaturely
drops from the tree, or, if plucked from the
tree, is useless; in the other case, the wife either does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>not bear children—she is barren—or she has frequent
miscarriages—“untimely fruit”—or she bears puny,
sickly children, who often either drop into an early
grave, or, if they live, probably drag out a miserable
existence. You may as well expect “to gather grapes
of thorns, or figs of thistles,” as healthy children from
unhealthy parents!</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Unhealthy parents, then, as a matter of course
have unhealthy children; this is as truly the case as
the night follows the day, and should deter both man
and woman so circumstanced from marrying. There
are numerous other complaints besides scrofula and
insanity inherited and propagated by parents. It is a
fearful responsibility, both to men and women, if they
be not healthy, to marry. The result must, as a matter
of course, be misery!</p>

<p class='c008'>10. If a wife is to be healthy and strong, she must
use the means—she must sow before she can reap;
health will not come by merely wishing for it! The
means are not always at first agreeable; but, like many
other things, habit makes them so. Early rising, for
instance, is not agreeable to the lazy, and to one fond
of her bed; but it is essentially necessary to sound
health. Exercise is not agreeable to the indolent; but
no woman can be really strong without it. Thorough
ablution of the whole body is distasteful and troublesome
to one not accustomed to much washing—to one
laboring under a kind of hydrophobia; but there is no
perfect health without the <i>daily</i> cleansing of the <i>whole</i>
skin.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>11. But all these processes entail trouble. True: is
anything in this world to be done without trouble? and
is not the acquisition of precious health worth trouble?
Yes, it is worth more than all our other acquisitions
put together! Life without health is a burden; life
with health is a joy and gladness! Up, then, and
arouse yourself, and be doing! No time is to be lost if
you wish to be well, to be a mother, and to be a mother
of healthy children. The misfortune of it is, many
ladies are more than half asleep, and are not aroused
to danger till danger stares them in the face; they are
not cognizant of ill health slowly creeping upon them,
until, in too many cases, the time is gone by for relief,
and ill health has become confirmed—has become a
part and parcel of themselves; they do not lock the
stable until the steed be stolen; they do not use the
means until the means are of no avail:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which we ascribe to Heaven: the fated sky</div>
      <div class='line'>Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull</div>
      <div class='line'>Our slow designs, when we ourselves are dull.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>12. Idleness is the mother of many diseases; she
breeds them, feeds them, and fosters them, and is, moreover,
a great enemy to fecundity. Idleness makes
people miserable. I have heard a young girl—surrounded
with every luxury—bemoan her lot, and complain
that she was most unhappy in consequence of
not having anything to do, and who wished that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>had been a servant, so that she might have been
obliged to work for her living. Idleness is certainly
the hardest work in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>13. It frequently happens that a lady, surrounded
with every luxury and every comfort, drags out a
miserable existence; she cannot say that she ever,
even for a single day, really feels well and strong.
This is not to live—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For life is not to live, but to be well.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>14. If a person be in perfect health, the very act of
living is itself thorough enjoyment, the greatest this
world can ever bestow. How needful it therefore is
that all necessary instruction should be imparted to
every Young Wife, and that proper means should, in
every way, be used to insure health!</p>

<p class='c008'>15. The judicious spending of the first year of married
life is of the greatest importance in the making and in
the strengthening of a wife’s constitution, and in preparing
her for having a family. How sad it is, then, that
it is the first twelve months that is, as a rule, especially
chosen to mar and ruin her own health, and to make
her childless! The present fashionable system of spending
the first few months of married life in a round of
visiting, of late hours, and in close and heated rooms,
calls loudly for a change. How many valuable lives
have been sacrificed to such a custom! How many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>miscarriages, premature births, and still-born children,
have resulted therefrom! How many homes have
been made childless—desolate—by it! Time it is
that common sense should take the place of such
folly! The present system is abominable, is rotten
at the core, and is fraught with the greatest danger
to human life and human happiness. How often a
lady is, during the first year of her wifehood, gadding
out night after night,—one evening to a dinner
party, the next night to private theatricals, the third
to an evening party, the fourth to the theater, the
fifth to a ball, the sixth to a concert, until in some
cases every night except Sunday night is consumed in
this way,—coming home frequently in the small hours
of the morning, through damp or fog, or rain or snow,
feverish, flushed, and excited—too tired until the morning
to sleep, when she should be up, out, and about.
When the morning dawns she falls into a heavy, unrefreshing
slumber, and wakes not until noon, tired, and
unfit for the duties of the day! Night after night—gas,
crowded rooms, carbonic acid gas, late hours, wine, and
excitement are her portion. As long as such a plan is
adopted the preacher preacheth but in vain. Night
after night, week after week, month after month, this
game is carried on, until at length either an illness or
broken health supervenes. Surely these are not the
best means to insure health and a family and healthy
progeny! The fact is, a wife nowadays is too artificial;
she lives on excitement; it is like drinking no
wine but champagne, and, like champagne taken in
excess, it soon plays sad havoc with her constitution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The pure and exquisite enjoyments of nature are with
her too commonplace, tame, low, and vulgar. How little
does such a wife know of the domestic happiness so
graphically and sweetly described by that poet of the
affections, Cowper:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fireside enjoyments, home-born happiness,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the comforts that the lowly roof</div>
      <div class='line'>Of undisturb’d retirement, and the hours</div>
      <div class='line'>Of long uninterrupted evening, know.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>16. A fashionable lady might say, “I cannot give
up fashionable amusements; I must enjoy myself as
others do; I might as well be out of the world as out
of the fashion.” To such a one I reply, “I myself
am not a fashionist—it is not in my line; and as in the
following pages I have to tell some plain unvarnished
truths, my advice to you is, close this book at once and
read no more of it, as such a work as this cannot be of
the slightest use to you, however it might be to one who
values health ‘as a jewel of great price’—as one of her
most precious earthly possessions.” Really the subject
is assuming such a serious aspect that it behooves a
medical man to speak out plainly and unreservedly, and
to call things by their right names. Fashion is oftentimes
but another name for suicide and for baby-slaughter—for
“massacre of the innocents!” God help the poor
unfortunate little child whose mother is a votary of
fashion, who spends her time in a round and whirl of
fashionable life, and leaves her child to the tender mercies
of servants, who “gang their ain gait,” and leave
their little charge to do the same. Such a mother is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>more unnatural than a wild beast; for a wild beast, as
a rule, is gentle, tender, and attentive to its offspring,
scarcely ever for a moment allowing its young to be out
of its sight. Truly, fashionable life deadens the feelings
and affections. I am quite aware that what I have just
now written will, by many fashionable ladies, be pooh-poohed,
and be passed by as “the idle wind.” They
love their pleasures far above either their own or their
children’s health, and will not allow anything, however
precious, to interfere with them; but still I have confidence
that many of my judicious readers will see the
truth and justness of my remarks, and will profit by
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>17. A round of visiting, a succession of rich living,
and a want of rest during the first year of a wife’s life,
often plays sad havoc with her health, and takes away
years from her existence. Moreover, such proceedings
often mar the chances of her ever becoming a mother, and
then she will have real cause to grieve over her fatuity.</p>

<p class='c008'>18. A French poet once sung that a house without a
child is like a garden without a flower, or like a cage
without a bird. The love of offspring is one of the
strongest instincts implanted in woman; there is nothing
that will compensate for the want of children. A
wife yearns for them; they are as necessary to her happiness
as the food she eats and as the air she breathes.
If this be true—which, I think, cannot be gainsayed—how
important is our subject,—one of the most important
that can in this world engage one’s attention, requiring
deep consideration and earnest study.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>19. The first year of a married woman’s life generally
determines whether, for the remainder of her existence,
she shall be healthy and strong, or shall be
delicate and weak; whether she shall be the mother of
fine, healthy children, or—if, indeed, she be a mother
at all—of sickly, undersized offspring—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Born but to weep, and destined to sustain</div>
      <div class='line'>A youth of wretchedness, an age of pain.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If she be not a parent, her mission in life will be only
half performed, and she will be robbed of the greatest
happiness this world can afford. The delight of a
mother, on first calling a child her own, is exquisite,
and is beautifully expressed in the following lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He was my ain, and dear to me</div>
      <div class='line'>As the heather-bell to the honey-bee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or the braird to the mountain hare.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>20. I should recommend a young wife to remember
the momentous mission she has to fulfill; to ponder on
the importance of bringing <i>healthy</i> children into the
world; to bear in mind the high duties that she owes
herself, her husband, her children, and society; to consider
well the value of health—“The first wealth is
health;”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and never to forget that “life has its duties
ever.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>21. A young married lady ought at once to commence
to take regular and systematic <i>out-door exercise</i>,
which might be done without in the least interfering
with her household duties. There are few things more
conducive to health than walking exercise; and one
advantage of our climate is, that there are but few
days in the year in which, at some period of the day,
it might not be taken. Walking—I mean a walk, not
a stroll—is a glorious exercise; it expands the chest and
throws back the shoulders; it strengthens the muscles;
it promotes digestion, making a person digest almost
any kind of food; it tends to open the bowels, and is
better than any aperient pill ever invented; it clears
the complexion, giving roses to the cheeks and brilliancy
to the eye, and, in point of fact, is one of the
greatest beautifiers in the world. It exhilarates the
spirits like a glass of champagne, but, unlike champagne,
it never leaves a headache behind. If ladies
would walk more than they do, there would be fewer
lackadaisical, useless, complaining wives than there at
present are; and, instead of having a race of puny children,
we should have a race of giants. Walking exercise
is worthy of all commendation, and is indispensable
to content, health, strength, and comeliness. Of
course, if a lady be pregnant, walking must then be
cautiously pursued; but still, walking in moderation is
even then absolutely necessary, and tends to keep off
many of the wretchedly depressing symptoms, often,
especially in a first pregnancy, accompanying that state.
I am quite sure that there is nothing more conducive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to health than the wearing out of lots of shoe-leather
and that leather is cheaper than physic.</p>

<p class='c008'>22. Walking is even more necessary in the winter
than in the summer. If the day be cold, and the roads
be dirty, provided it be dry above, I should advise my
fair reader to put on thick boots and a warm shawl,
and to brave the weather. Even if there be a little
rain and much wind, if she be well wrapped up, neither
the rain nor the wind will harm her. A little sprinkling
of rain, provided the rules of health be followed,
will not give her cold. Much wind will not blow her
away. She must, if she wishes to be strong, fight
against it; the conflict will bring the color to her cheek
and beauty to her eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>23. Let her exert herself; let her mind conquer any
indolence of the body; let her throw off her lethargy—it
only requires a little determination; let her be up
and doing; for life, both to man and woman, is a battle,
and must be fought valiantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>24. Bear in mind, then, that if a lady is to be healthy,
she <i>must</i> take exercise, and that not by fits and starts,
but regularly and systematically. A stroll is of little
use; she must walk! And let there be no mistake
about it, for Nature will have her dues: the muscles
require to be tired, and not to be trifled with; the lungs
ask for the revivifying air of heaven, and not for the
stifling air of a close room; the circulation demands
the quickening influence of a brisk walk, and not to be
made stagnant by idleness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>25. This world was never made for idleness; everything
around and about us tells of action and of progress.
Idle people are miserable people; idle people
are diseased people; there is no mistake about it.
There is no substitute in this world for exercise and for
occupation; neither physic nor food will keep people
in health; they must be up and doing, and buckle on
their armor, and fight, as every one has to fight, the
battle of life! Mr. Milne, the master of the North
Warwickshire hounds, lately, at a hunt dinner, pithily
remarked “that fox-hunting was the best physic for
improving a bad constitution.” I am quite sure, with
regard to the fair sex, that an abundance of walking
exercise and of household occupation is decidedly the
best physic for improving a lady’s constitution, more
especially if she have, as unfortunately too many of
them have, a bad one; indeed, an abundance of walking
exercise and of household occupation will frequently
convert a bad into a good constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>26. Moreover, there is not a greater beautifier in the
world than fresh air and exercise; a lady who lives half
her time in the open air, in God’s sunshine, and who
takes plenty of walking exercise, has generally a clear
and beautiful complexion—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“She looks as clear</div>
      <div class='line'>As morning roses newly washed with dew.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>27. Do not let me be misunderstood: I am not advocating
that a delicate lady, unaccustomed to exercise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>should at once take violent and long-continued exercise;
certainly not. Let a delicate lady <i>learn</i> to take exercise,
as a young child would <i>learn</i> to walk—by degrees; let
her creep, and then go; let her gradually increase her
exercise, and let her do nothing either rashly or unadvisedly.
If a child attempted to run before he could
walk, he would stumble and fall. A delicate lady requires
just as much care in the training to take exercise
as a child does in the learning to walk; but exercise
must be learned and must be practiced, if a lady, or any
one else, is to be healthy and strong. Unfortunately,
in this our day the importance of exercise as a means
of health is but little understood and but rarely practiced;
notwithstanding, a lady may rest assured that
until a “change comes o’er the spirit of her dreams,”
ill health will be her daily and constant companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>28. A lady should walk <i>early</i> in the morning, and not
<i>late</i> in the evening. The dews of evening are dangerous,
and are apt to give severe colds, fevers, and other diseases.
Dew is more likely to cause cold than rain—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The dews of the evening most carefully shun—</div>
      <div class='line'>Those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>29. A breath of wind is not allowed to blow on many
a fair face. The consequence is, that her cheek becomes
sallow, wan, “as wan as clay,” and bloodless, or if it
has a color it is the hectic flush, which tells of speedy
decay!</p>

<p class='c008'>30. Sitting over the fire will spoil her complexion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>causing it to be muddy, speckled, and sallow. The
finest complexion in a lady I ever saw belonged to one
who would never go, even in the coldest weather, near
the fire: although she was nearly thirty years of age,
her cheeks were like roses, and she had the most
beautiful red and white I ever beheld; it reminded me
of Shakspeare’s matchless description of a complexion:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white</div>
      <div class='line'>Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>31. Sitting over the fire will make her chilly, nervous,
dyspeptic, and dispirited. It will cause her to be more
chilly, and thus will make her more susceptible of catching
cold; and it will frequently produce chilblains. If
she be cold, the sitting over the fire will only warm her
for the time, and will make her feel more starved when
she leaves it. Crouching over the fire, as many do, is
ruination to health and strength and comeliness! Sitting
over the fire will make her nervous: the heat from
the fire is weakening beyond measure to the nerves.
It will disorder and enfeeble her stomach—for nothing
debilitates the stomach like great heat—and thus make
her dyspeptic; and if she be dyspeptic, she will, she
must be dispirited. The one follows the other as surely
as the night follows the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>32. If sitting over the fire be hurtful, sitting with the
back to the fire is still more so. The back to the fire
often causes both sickness and faintness, injures the
spine, and weakens the spinal marrow, and thus debilitates
the whole frame.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>33. A walk on a clear, frosty morning is as exhilarating
to the spirits as the drinking of champagne—with
this difference, that on the day following the head is
improved by the one, but not always by the other.
Simple nature’s pleasures are the most desirable—they
leave no sting behind them!</p>

<p class='c008'>34. There is nothing like a long walk to warm the
body and to make the blood course merrily through
the blood-vessels. I consider it to be a great misfortune
that my fair countrywomen do not use their legs more
and their carriages less. “As to exercise, few women
care to take it for mere health’s sake. The rich are too
apt to think that riding in a close varnish-smelling carriage
ought to be a very good substitute for muscular
struggles in the open air.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>35. Unfortunately this is an age of luxury. Everything
is artificial, and disease and weakness, and even
barrenness, follow as a matter of course. In proof of
my assertion that this is an age of luxury, look at the
present sumptuous style of living: carriages rolling
about in every direction; dining-tables groaning under
the weight of rich dinners, and expensive wines flowing
like water; grand dresses sweeping the streets,
almost doing away with the necessity for scavengers.
I say, advisedly, <i>streets</i>; for <i>green fields</i> are, unfortunately,
scarcely ever visited by ladies. We are
almost, in extravagance, rivaling ancient Rome just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>before luxury sapped her strength and laid her in
ruins!</p>

<p class='c008'>36. If a lady has to travel half a mile she must have
her carriage. Strange infatuation! Is she not aware
that she has hundreds of muscles that want exercising?
that she has lungs that require expanding? that she
has nerves that demand bracing? that she has blood
that needs circulating? And how does she think that
the muscles can be exercised, that the lungs can be
expanded, that the nerves can be braced, and that the
blood can be properly circulated, unless these are all
made to perform their proper functions by an abundance
of <i>walking</i> exercise? It is utterly impossible!</p>

<p class='c008'>37. Does she desire to be strong? Then let her
take exercise! Does she hope to retain her bloom and
her youthful appearance, and still to look charming in
the eyes of her husband? Then let her take exercise!
Does she wish to banish nervousness and low spirits?
Then let her take exercise! There is nothing standing
still in Nature: if it were, creation would languish and
die. There is a perpetual motion! And so must we
be constantly employed (when not asleep), if we are
to be healthy and strong! Nature will not be trifled
with; these are her laws<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a>—immutable and unchangeable,
and we cannot infringe them with impunity:</p>

<p class='c008'>38. If a newly-married woman be delicate, as, unfortunately,
too many are, she may be made to bear
exercise well, provided she begins by taking a short
walk at first—be it ever so short—and by gradually
increasing it until she be able to take a tolerably long
one. She might find it irksome at the beginning, and
might be inclined to give it up in despair; but if she
value her health and happiness, let me urge her to
persevere, and she may depend upon it that she will
be amply rewarded for her trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>39. A delicate lady frequently complains of <i>cold</i>
feet; she has neither sufficient food nor sufficient exercise
to keep them warm. Walking and plenty of nourishment
are the best remedies she can use to warm
them. If they be cold before retiring to rest—a frequent
cause of keeping her awake—let her walk briskly
for half an hour, before undressing for the night, about
either the hall, or the landing, or a large room.</p>

<p class='c008'>40. Some ladies declare that they are always cold,
their feet especially, which are as cold as ice! The fact
is, they not only do not take exercise enough, but they
do not take nourishment enough—breakfast especially—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>keep them warm. Many ladies really and truly
half starve themselves; they consider it to be vulgar
to eat much, and to satisfy their appetite! they deem
it low to take a long walk: every poor woman can do
that! it is much more easy and pleasant to loll back
in an easy carriage, and to be rolled along! Truly;
but if carriage exercise be more agreeable, is it as
healthful? Certainly not: there is very little exercise
in riding in a carriage; but every organ, muscle, nerve,
and blood-vessel of the body is put into beneficial
action by walking. Walking is essential to health;
there is no substitute for it; there certainly is no perfect
health without it.</p>

<p class='c008'>41. The reason why my fair countrywomen take so
much opening medicine is the want of exercise. How
truly it has been said that “physic, for the most part,
in nothing else but the substitute of exercise and temperance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>42. I consider it to be a grievous misfortune for any
one—man, woman, or child—who cannot, without the
frequent taking of physic, keep their bowels regular.
When such is the case there is something wrong, very
wrong, about her system and about her proceedings,
and the sooner the matter is inquired into and rectified
the better. The necessity of a constant swallowing of
opening medicine is a proof of chronic ill health, and
will in time injure her constitution beyond remedy. I
cannot speak too strongly on this subject; I have, in
my professional experience, seen so much mischief and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>misery caused by the frequent swallowing of opening
pills, that I should not do my duty if I did not raise
my voice against the abominable custom. Why, many
ladies make a practice, during the whole of their lives,
of taking two or three times a week opening pills! The
bowels, they say, will not act without them; but I
maintain that if they would resolutely refrain from
swallowing them, and adopt the rules of health laid
down in these pages, they would be able altogether to
dispense with them, to their great benefit and delectation.
But then the rules of health require trouble and
perseverance—(and what that is worth having does
not?)—while the swallowing of a couple of pills might
be done quickly, and with very little trouble; but
although the frequent taking of pills gives at the time
but little trouble, they cause much trouble afterwards!
Look, then, at the results of each system, and decide
accordingly! It has been said that “gluttony kills
more than the sword;” my conviction is, that the constant
taking of opening medicine kills more than gluttony
and the sword combined! The abuse of aperients
is one of the crying evils of the day, and who so proper
as a medical man to raise his voice to suppress, or at
all events to lessen, the evil?</p>

<p class='c008'>43. If a lady be costive, and is in consequence inclined
to take a dose of physic, let me advise her to
take instead a long walk, which will in the majority of
cases do her vastly more good; and if requiring repetition,
the one is far more agreeable, and the effects
are much more likely to be lasting than the other.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Exercise, I am quite sure, is, as a rule, in the long
run much more effectual and beneficial than opening
physic.</p>

<p class='c008'>44. A newly-married wife ought to be cautious in
the taking of horse exercise. As long as she be <i>not</i>
pregnant, horse exercise is very beneficial to health,
and is a great enjoyment; but the moment symptoms
of pregnancy develop themselves, she must instantly
give it up, or it will probably cause her to miscarry.</p>

<p class='c008'>45. Let her breathe the pure air of heaven, rather
than the close contaminated air either of an assembly
or of a concert-room. The air of an assembly or of a
concert-room is contaminated with carbonic acid gas.
The gas-lights and the respiration of numbers of persons
give off carbonic acid gas, which gas is highly
poisonous.</p>

<p class='c008'>46. The truth of this assertion is patent to every one
who will observe the effects that a large assembly,
more especially in the evening, when the gas or candles
are flaring away, has on the system; the headache,
the oppression, the confusion of ideas, the loss of appetite,
the tired feeling, followed by a restless night—all
tell a tale, and loudly proclaim that either an assembly
or a concert-room is not a fit place for a young wife
desirous of having a family.</p>

<p class='c008'>47. Let a young married lady attend well to the
<i>ventilation</i> of her house. She may depend upon it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that ventilation, thorough ventilation, will prove one
of the best friends she has in the world. Let her give
directions to her servant to have early every morning
every window in the house opened, as the <i>morning</i> air
is fresher and sweeter than it is later in the day. “For
ventilation, open your windows both at top and bottom.
The fresh air rushes in one way, while the foul makes
its exit the other. This is letting in your friend and
expelling your enemy.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> This opening of the window,
top and bottom, of course applies only to the rooms
that are <i>unoccupied</i>:—in an <i>occupied</i> room in hot
weather one sash only—the lower, as a rule, is best—ought
to be opened. If the <i>upper</i> be lowered when
the room is occupied, the cold air is apt to strike on the
top of the head, and to give cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>48. Let her give orders that every chimney in the
house be unstopped, and let her see for herself that her
orders have been obeyed; for servants, if they have
the chance, will stop up chimneys, as they are fully
aware that dust and dirt will come down chimneys,
and that it will give them a little extra work to do.
But the mistress has to see to the health of herself and
of her household, which is of far more consequence
than either a little dirt or extra work for her servants.</p>

<p class='c008'>49. She may rest assured that it is utterly impossible
for herself and for her family to have perfect health
if the chimneys are allowed to be stopped. I assert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>this fearlessly, for I have paid great attention to the
subject. If the chimney be stopped, the apartment
<i>must</i> necessarily become contaminated with carbonic
acid gas, the refuse of respiration, which is, as I have
before stated, a <i>deadly</i> poison.</p>

<p class='c008'>50. Chimneys, in many country houses, are permanently
and hermetically stopped: if we have the ill-fortune
to sleep in such rooms, we feel half-suffocated.
<i>Sleep</i>, did I say? No! <i>tumble</i> and <i>toss</i> are the right
words to express the real meaning; for in such chambers
very little sleep do we get,—unless, indeed, we
open the windows to let in the air, which, in such an
extremity, is the only thing, if we wish to get a wink
of sleep, we can do! Stopped-up bedroom chimneys
is one and an important reason why some persons do
not derive the benefit they otherwise would do of
change of air to the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>51. I unhesitatingly declare that ninety-nine bedrooms
out of every hundred are badly ventilated; that
in the morning, after they have been slept in, they are
full both of impure and of poisoned air. I say, advisedly,
impure and poisoned air, for the air becomes foul and
deadly if not perpetually changed—if not constantly
mixed, both by day and by night, with fresh, pure, external
air. Many persons, by breathing the same air
over and over again, are literally “poisoned by their
own breaths!” This is not an exaggerated statement—alas,
it is too true! Let every young wife remember
that she requires just as much pure air in the night as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the day; and if she does not have it, her sleep will
neither refresh her nor strengthen her, but that she
will rise in the morning more weary than on the previous
night when she retired to rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>52. The way to make a house healthy, and to keep
off disease, is by <i>thorough ventilation</i>—by allowing a
current of air, both by day and by night, to constantly
enter and to sweep through the house, and every room
of the house. This may be done either by open skylight
or by open landing windows, which should <i>always</i>
be left open; and by allowing every chamber window
to be wide open during the day, and every chamber
door to be a little open both by night and by day,
having a door-chain on each door during the night to
prevent intrusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>53. Let her, if she can, live in the country. In a
town, coal fires—manufactories, many of them unhealthy—confined
space—the exhalations from the
lungs and from the skin of the inhabitants, numbers of
them diseased,—all tend to load the air with impurities.
Moreover, if in the town she desire a walk, it is
often itself a walk, and a long one too, before she can
get into the country—before she can obtain glimpses
of green fields and breathe the fresh air; hence walks
in the town do but comparatively little good. In the
country her lungs are not cheated: they get what they
want—a good article, pure air—and the eye and heart
are both gladdened with the beauties of nature. I
consider the following remark of Dr. Grosvenor, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>excellent <cite>Essay on Health</cite>, very pertinent. He observes:
“Hence it is that one seldom sees in cities,
courts, and rich houses, where people eat and drink,
and indulge in the pleasure of appetite, that perfect
health and athletic soundness and vigor which is commonly
seen in the country, in the poor houses and
cottages, where nature is their cook and necessity is
their caterer, where they have no other doctor but the
sun and fresh air, and no other physic but exercise and
temperance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>54. Cold air is frequently looked upon as an enemy,
instead of being contemplated as, what it really is to a
healthy person, a friend. The effect of cold upon the
stomach is well exemplified in a walk in frosty weather,
producing an appetite. “Cold air,” says Dr. Cullen,
“applied with exercise, is a most powerful tonic with
respect to the stomach; and this explains why, for that
purpose, no exercise within doors, or in close carriages,
is so useful as that in the open air.”</p>

<p class='c008'>55. Hot and close rooms, soft cushions, and luxurious
couches must be eschewed. I have somewhere
read, that if a fine, healthy whelp of the bull-dog
species were fed upon chicken, rice, and delicacies, and
made to lie upon soft cushions, and if, for some months,
he were shut up in a close room, when he grew up he
would become unhealthy, weak, and spiritless. So
it is with a young married woman; the more she indulges,
the more unhealthy, weak, and inanimate she
becomes—unfit to perform the duties of a wife and the
offices of a mother, if, indeed, she be a mother at all!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>56. Rich and luxurious ladies are less likely to be
blessed with a family than poor and hard-worked women.
Here is, to a vengeance, compensation! Compensation
usually deals very justly both to man and womankind.
For instance, riches and childlessness, poverty
and children, laziness and disease, hard work and
health, a hard-earned crust and contentment, a gilded
chamber and discontent—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“These are ofttimes wedded as a man and wife,</div>
      <div class='line'>And linked together, hand in hand, through life.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Riches seldom bring health, content, many children,
and happiness; they more frequently cause disease,
discontent, childlessness, and misery.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Riches and indolence
are often as closely united as the Siamese
twins, disease and death frequently following in their
train. “Give me neither poverty nor riches” was a
glorious saying of the wisest of men. Rich and luxurious
living, then, is very antagonistic to fecundity.
This might be one reason why <i>poor</i> curates’ wives and
poor Irish women generally have such large families.
It has been proved by experience that a diet, principally
consisting of milk, buttermilk, and vegetables, is
more conducive to fecundity than a diet almost exclusively
of meat. In illustration of my argument, the
poor Irish, who have usually such enormous families,
live almost exclusively on buttermilk and potatoes;
they scarcely eat meat from year’s end to year’s end.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Riches, if it prevent a lady from having children, is an
evil and a curse, rather than a good and a blessing;
for, after all, the greatest treasures in this world are
“household treasures”—healthy children! If a wife
be ever so rich, and she be childless, she is, as a rule,
discontented and miserable. Many a married lady
would gladly give up half her worldly possessions to
be a mother; and well she might—children are far more
valuable. I have heard a wife exclaim with Rachel,
“Give me a child, or I die.”</p>

<p class='c008'>57. If a young wife be likely to have a family, let
her continue to live heartily and well; but if she have
been married a year or two without any prospect of an
increase, let her commence to live abstemiously on
fresh milk, buttermilk, bread, potatoes, and farinaceous
diet, with very little meat, and <i>no stimulants whatever</i>;
let her live, indeed, very much either as a poor curate’s
wife, or as a poor Irish woman is compelled to live.</p>

<p class='c008'>58. It is not the poor woman that is cursed with
barrenness—she has often more mouths than she can
well fill; but the one that frequently labors under that
ban is the pampered, the luxurious, the indolent, the
fashionable wife; and most assuredly, until she change
her system of living to one more consonant with common sense,
she will continue to do so. It is grievous
to contemplate that oftentimes a lady, with every other
temporal good, is deficient of two earthly blessings—health
and children; and still more lamentable, when
we know that they frequently arise from her own seeking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>that they are withheld from her in consequence of
her being a votary of fashion. Many of the ladies of
the present day, too, if they do bear children, are,
from delicacy of constitution, quite unable to suckle
them. Should such things be? But why, it might
be asked, speak so strongly and make so much fuss
about it? Because the disease is become desperate,
and delays are dangerous—because children among the
higher ranks are become few and far between; and
who so proper as a medical man to raise his voice to
proclaim the facts, the causes, and the treatment? I
respectfully inquire of my fair reader, Is fashion a
wife’s mission? If it be not, what is her mission? I
myself have an idea—a very ancient and an almost
obsolete one—that the mission of a wife is a glorious
mission, far removed from fashion and from folly. A
fashionable wife, after a fashionable season, is frequently
hysterical and excitable, and therefore exhausted;
she is more dead than alive, and is obliged
to fly to the country and dose herself with quinine to
recruit her wasted energies. Is such a wife as this
likely to become a joyful mother of children? I trow
not. Her time is taken up between pleasure and excitement
to make herself ill, and nursing to make herself
well, in order that she may, at the earliest possible
moment, again return to her fashionable pursuits,
which have with her become, like drinking in excess, a
necessity. Indeed, a fashionable life is a species of
intoxication. Moreover, wine-drinking in excess and
a fashionable life are usually joined together. Sad infatuation,
destructive alike to human life and human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>happiness—a road that often leads to misery, disappointment,
and death! These are strong expressions,
but they are not stronger than the subject imperatively
demands—a subject which is becoming of vital importance
to the well-being of society, and, in the higher
ranks, even to its very existence, and which must, ere
long, engross the attention of all who love their country.
Fashion is a sapper and miner, and is ever hard
at work sapping and undermining the constitutions of
its votaries. Something must be done, and that quickly,
to defeat its machinations, otherwise evils will, past
remedy, be consummated.</p>

<p class='c008'>59. I consider <i>thorough ablution</i> of the body every
morning one of the most important means of health to
a young wife; “while the poor, in the matter of washing,
are apt to think that they can put off till Saturday
what ought to be performed every day, and that they
can wind up the week by a good wash with impunity.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
There is nothing more tonic and invigorating and refreshing
than cold ablution. Moreover, it makes one
feel clean and sweet and wholesome; and you may
depend upon it, that it not only improves our physical
constitution, but likewise our moral character, and
makes our minds more pure and holy. A dirty man
has generally a dirty mind!</p>

<p class='c008'>60. The ewers and basins in our own country are,
for the purposes of thorough ablution, ridiculously small,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>while on the Continent they are still smaller. They are
of pigmy dimensions—the basins being of the size of an
ordinary slop-basin, and the ewer holding enough water
to wash a finger. How can persons with such appliances
be either decently clean, or sweet, or thoroughly
healthy? It is utterly impossible. Many people on
the Continent have a dread of water—they labor under
a species of hydrophobia: hence one reason why the
ewers and basins are of such dwarfish proportions.</p>

<p class='c008'>61. A young wife ought to strip to the waist, and
then proceed to wash her face after the manner so well
described by Erasmus Wilson in his work on <cite>Healthy
Skin</cite>. He says: “Fill your basin about two-thirds
full with fresh water; dip your face in the water, and
then your hands. Soap the hands well, and pass the
soaped hands with gentle friction over the whole face.
Having performed this part of the operation thoroughly,
dip the face in the water a second time, and rinse it
completely; you may add very much to the luxury of
the latter part of the process by having a second basin
ready with fresh water to perform a final rinsing....
In washing the face you have three objects to fulfill:
to remove the dirt, to give freshness, and to give tone
and vigor to the skin.” Now for the remaining process
of ablution. Having well rubbed her neck with
her soaped hands, she ought thoroughly to bathe her
neck, her chest, and arms, by means of a large sponge
dipped in cold water—the colder the better. She cannot
cleanse her own shoulders, back, and loins with a
sponge—she cannot get to them. To obviate this difficulty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>she ought to soak a piece of flannel, a yard
and a half long and half a yard wide, folded lengthways,
in <i>cold</i> water, and throwing it over her shoulders,
as she would a skipping-rope, she should for a
few times work it from right to left and from left to
right, “and up and down, and then athwart,” her loins
and back and shoulders. This plan will effectually
cleanse parts that she could not otherwise reach, and
will be most refreshing and delightful. She should
then put both her hands, her forearms, and her arms
into the basin of water as far as they will reach, and
keep them in for a few seconds, or while she can count
fifty. The wet parts should be expeditiously dried.
Then, having thrown off her remaining clothes, and
merely having her slippers on, she ought to sit for a
few seconds, or while in the winter she can count fifty,
or while in the summer she can count a hundred,
either in a sitz-bath,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> or in a very large wash-hand basin—called
a nursery-basin<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> (sold for the purpose of giving
an infant his morning bath)—containing water to
the depth of three or four inches. While sitting either
in the bath or in the basin, she ought in the winter
time to have either a small blanket or a woolen shawl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>thrown over her shoulders. If she has any difficulty
in getting in and out of the basin, she should place a
chair on each side of the basin; she can then, by pressing
upon the chairs with her elbows, arms, and hands,
readily do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>62. If a lady be too delicate to take a sitz-bath, or
if a sitz-bath should not agree with her, then she ought
every morning to use the bidet, and, while sitting over
it, she should well sponge the parts with the water,
allowing the water for a few seconds to stream over
them. Every lady should bear in mind that either the
sitz-bath or the bidet, every morning of her life (except
under certain circumstances), is absolutely essential to
her comfort and her well-being.</p>

<p class='c008'>63. At first, until she become accustomed to the cold
(which she will do in a few days), she ought to use
the water <i>tepid</i>, but the sooner she can use <i>cold</i> water,
and that plentifully, the better—as it will greatly contribute
to her health and strength. But, as I said before,
the process ought to be quickly performed, as it
is the shock in bracing and in strengthening the system
that does so much good.</p>

<p class='c008'>64. When a lady is very delicate, it may, <i>during
the winter</i>, be necessary to put a dash of <i>warm</i> water
into the bath, in order to take off the <i>extreme</i> chill;
but, as she becomes stronger, she will be able to dispense
with the <i>warm</i> water, as the colder the water is,
provided she can bear it, the more good it will do her.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>65. If her loins or her back are at all weak, the
addition either of a large handful of table salt, or of a
small handful of bay salt, or of a lump of rock-salt,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
dissolved in the water in the sitz-bath, will be of great
service to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>66. The feet and the legs ought every morning to be
bathed—not by standing in the water, but, on the completion
of the washing of the other parts of the body,
by putting one foot at a time for a few seconds (not
minutes) in the basin containing the water (the basin
for that purpose being placed on the floor), and well
and quickly washing the foot, either with a flannel or
with a sponge, and well cleansing with the finger and
thumb between each toe, and allowing the water from
the sponge or flannel to stream into the basin from the
knee downwards. All this, of course, must be done
expeditiously; and care ought to be taken, after such
ablution, to well dry with a towel between each toe.
The washing of the feet as above directed will be a
great refreshment, and will be most beneficial to health,
and will be a means of warding off colds, of preventing
chilblains, and of preserving the feet in a sweet and
healthy state. The feet ought to be kept as clean, if
not cleaner, than the hands. Parts that are not seen
should be kept cleaner than parts that are seen. Filth
is apt to gather in covered up places.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>67. The moment she has finished her bath she ought
quickly to dry herself. I should recommend her to
use as a towel the Turkish rubber: it will cause a
delightful glow of the whole body.</p>

<p class='c008'>68. The whole of the body, except the hair of the
head, is, by the above method, every morning thoroughly
washed. The hair of the head ought occasionally,
even with soap and water, to be cleansed, to keep
it clean and sweet and wholesome; for nothing is more
dirty if it be not well attended to than human hair,
and nothing is more repulsive than a dirty head.</p>

<p class='c008'>69. Brushing of the hair, although beneficial both to
the hair and health, will not alone thoroughly cleanse
the hair and scalp.</p>

<p class='c008'>70. Some ladies attempt to clean their hair by simply
washing it either with rosemary or with rosewater,
or with other washes; but there is no more effectual
way of doing it than occasionally by a flannel and soap
and water.</p>

<p class='c008'>71. Bathing in the sea during the season, provided
no grease has been previously used, is very good for
the hair; it both strengthens the roots and beautifies
the color.</p>

<p class='c008'>72. I should advise my fair reader not to plaster her
hair either with grease or with pomade, or with other
unknown compounds: many of them are apt to make
the head dirty, scurfy, and sore.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>73. It might be said that it is utterly impossible for
a lady to keep her hair tidy, unless she uses some application
to it. If such be the case, either a little best
olive oil or scented castor oil, or cocoanut oil, may, by
means of an old tooth-brush, be applied to smooth the
hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>74. If the hair should fall off, either a little cocoanut
oil or a little scented castor oil, well rubbed every night
and morning into the roots, is an excellent dressing.
These are simple remedies, and can never do any harm,
which is more than can be said of many quack nostrums,
which latter often injure the hair irreparably.</p>

<p class='c008'>75. The best carpet, either for a bath-room or for a
dressing-room, is kamptulicon, as the water spilt upon
it after the use of a bath or ablution can, by means of
a flannel, be readily absorbed; the window ought then
to be thrown wide open, and the room will quickly be
dried.</p>

<p class='c008'>76. It would be well for her, when practicable, to
have, after she has finished dressing, a quarter of an
hour’s walk, either in the garden or in the grounds, in
order to insure a reaction, and thus to induce a healthy
glow of the circulation, and to give her an appetite for
her breakfast. A quarter of an hour’s walk <i>before</i>
breakfast is more beneficial to health than an hour’s
walk <i>after</i> breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>77. If a lady have not been accustomed to a thorough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>ablution, as just directed, of her whole body, let her,
if possible, before commencing, take a trip to the coast,
and have a few dips in the sea; after which she might
at once go through the processes above advised with
safety, comfort, and advantage; but whether she be
able to bathe in the sea or not, she must, if she is to
be strong and healthy, gradually accustom herself to
a daily ablution of the whole of her body. The skin
is a breathing apparatus, and unless it be kept clean it
cannot properly perform its functions. It might be
said, it will take time and trouble daily to cleanse the
whole of the skin: it will; but no more than ten
minutes, or a quarter of an hour, to go through the
whole of the above processes of bathing and of drying
the skin. The acquisition of health takes both
time and trouble; but nothing worth having in this
world is done without it! There is no royal road to
health; but although the path at first might be a little
rugged and disagreeable, it soon becomes from practice
smooth and pleasant!</p>

<p class='c008'>78. Oh, if my fair reader did but know the value of
<i>thorough</i> cold water ablutions, she would not lose a
day before giving the plan I have above recommended
a trial. It would banish all, or nearly all, her little
ailments and nervousness; it would make her dispense
with many of her wrappings; it would, in the winter
time, keep her from coddling and crudling over the fire;
it would cause her to resist cold and disease; it would,
if she were inclined to constipation, tend to regulate
her bowels; it would strengthen her back and loins; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>would make her blooming, healthy, and strong; and it
would pave the way, and fit her, in due time, to become
a mother, and the mother of fine, hearty children! My
reader must not fancy that I have overdrawn the picture;
I have painted it from the life. “I only tell what
I do know, and declare what I do believe.” Let me
urge but a trial, and then my fair inquirer will have
cause to be thankful that she had been induced to carry
out my views, and I shall rejoice that I have been the
means of her doing so. Hear what a physician and a
poet, a man of sound sense and of sterling intellect,
says of the value of ablution. He speaks of <i>warm</i>
ablution, which certainly is, at the beginning of using
<i>thorough</i> ablution, the best; but the sooner <i>cold</i> can be
substituted for <i>warm</i> the better it will be for the health
and strength and spirits of the bather:</p>

<p class='c008'>79. <i>With regard to diet.</i>—Although I have a great
objection (which I either have or will particularize) of
a young wife taking rich food and many stimulants, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>I am a great advocate for an abundance of good wholesome
nourishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>80. The meager breakfasts of many young wives
(eating scarcely anything) is one cause of so much
sickness among them, and of so many puny children
in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>81. Let every young wife, and, indeed, every one
else, make a substantial breakfast. It is the foundation
meal of the day; it is the first meal after a long—the
longest fast. The meager, miserable breakfasts
many young wives make is perfectly absurd; no wonder
that they are weak, “nervous,” and delicate. A
breakfast ought, as a rule, to consist either of eggs or
of cold chicken, or of cold game, or of bacon, or of ham,
or of cold meat, or of mutton-chops, or of fish, and of
<i>plenty of good bread</i>, and <i>not</i> of either hot buttered
toast, or of hot rolls swimming in butter; both of
which latter articles are like giving the stomach sponge
to digest, and making the partaker of such food for the
rest of the day feel weak, spiritless, and miserable. If
she select coffee for breakfast, let the <i>half</i> consist of
good fresh milk; if she prefer cocoa, let it be made of
new milk instead of water; if she choose tea, let it be
<i>black</i> tea, with plenty of cream in it. Milk and cream
are splendid articles of diet. Let her then make a
hearty breakfast, and let there be no mistake about it.
There is no meal in the day so wretchedly managed,
so poor and miserable, and so devoid of nourishment,
as an English breakfast. Let every young wife, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>look well to the breakfast, that it be good and
varied and substantial, or ill health will almost certainly
ensue.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>82. A meager unsubstantial breakfast causes a sinking
sensation of the stomach and bowels, and for the
remainder of the day a miserable depression of spirits.
Robert Browning truly and quaintly remarks that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A sinking at the lower abdomen</div>
      <div class='line'>Begins the day with indifferent omen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>83. It frequently happens that a young wife has no
appetite for her breakfast. She may depend upon it,
in such a case, there is something wrong about her, and
that the sooner it is rectified the better it will be for
her health, for her happiness, and for her future prospects.
Let her, then, without loss of time seek medical
advice, that means may be used to bring back her
appetite. The stomach in all probability is at fault;
if it be, the want of appetite, the consequent sensation
of sinking of the stomach, and the depression of the
spirits are all explained; but which, with judicious
treatment, may soon be set to rights.</p>

<p class='c008'>84. If the loss of appetite for breakfast arise from
pregnancy—and sometimes it is one of the earliest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>symptoms—time will rectify it, and the appetite, without
the necessity of a particle of medicine, will shortly,
with its former zest, return.</p>

<p class='c008'>85. A young married woman’s diet ought to be substantial,
plain, and nourishing. She must frequently
vary the kind of food, of meat especially, as also the
manner of cooking it. Nature delights in variety of
food, of air, and of exercise. If she were fed, for some
considerable period, on one kind of meat, she could
scarcely digest any other; and in time either a disordered
or a diseased stomach would be likely to ensue.
I have sometimes heard, with pain and annoyance, a
patient advised to live on mutton-chops, and to have no
other meat than mutton! Now this is folly in the extreme.
Such an unfortunate patient’s stomach, in the
course of time, would not be able to digest any other
meat, and after awhile would have a difficulty in digesting
even mutton-chops, and wretched and ruined health
would to a certainty ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>86. Three substantial and nourishing meals a day will
be sufficient. It is a mistaken notion to imagine that
“little and often” is best. The stomach requires rest as
much as, or more than, any other part of the body; and
how, if food be constantly put into it, can it have rest?
There is no part of the body more imposed and put upon
than the human stomach:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“To spur beyond</div>
      <div class='line'>Its wiser will the jaded appetite,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Is this for pleasure? Learn a juster taste,</div>
      <div class='line'>And know that temperance is true luxury.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>87. It is a mistaken notion, and injurious to health,
for a young wife, or for any one else, to eat, just before
retiring to rest, a hearty meat supper:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oppress, not nature sinking down to rest</div>
      <div class='line'>With feasts too late, too solid, or too full.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>88. How often we hear a delicate lady declare that
she can only eat one meal a day, and that is a hearty
meat supper the last thing at night; and who, moreover,
affirms that she can neither sleep at night, nor can she
have the slightest appetite for any other meal but her
supper, and that she should really starve if she could
not have food when she could eat it! The fact is, the
oppressed stomach oppresses the brain, and drives away
sleep, and appetite, and health. The habit is utterly
wrong, and oftentimes demands professional means to
correct it.</p>

<p class='c008'>89. How is it that sometimes a lady who has an excellent
appetite is, notwithstanding, almost as thin as a
rake? It is not what she eats, but what she digests,
that makes her fat. Some people would fatten on bread
and water, while others would, on the fat of the land, be
as thin as Pharaoh’s lean kine. Our happiness and our
longevity much depend on the weakness or on the soundness
of our stomachs: it is the stomach, as a rule, that
both gauges our happiness and that determines the span
of the life of both men and women. How necessary it
is, then, that due regard should be paid to such an important
organ, and that everything should be done to
conduce to the stomach’s welfare,—not by overloading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the stomach with rich food; not by a scanty and meager
diet; but by adopting a middle course, betwixt and
between high living and low living—the <i>juste milieu</i>.
We should all of us remember that glorious saying—those
immortal words of St. Paul—“Be temperate in
all things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>90. Where a lady is very thin, good fresh milk (if it
agree) should form an important item of her diet.
Milk is both fattening and nourishing, more so than
any other article of food known; but it should never
be taken at the same meal (except it be in the form of
pudding) with either beer or wine: they are incompatibles,
and may cause disarrangement of the stomach
and bowels. Milk would often agree with an adult,
where it now disagrees, if the admixture of milk with
either beer or wine were never allowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>91. Let me advise my fair reader to take plenty of
time over her meals, and to chew her food well; as
nothing is more conducive to digestion than thoroughly
masticated food. No interruptions should be allowed
to interfere with the meals; the mind, at such times,
should be kept calm, cheerful, and unruffled, for “unquiet
meals make ill digestions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>92. Many persons bolt their food! When they do,
they are drawing bills on their constitutions which
must inevitably be paid! The teeth act as a mill to
grind and prepare the food for the stomach; if they
do not do their proper work, the stomach has double
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>labor to perform, and being unable to do it efficiently,
the stomach and the whole body in consequence
suffer.</p>

<p class='c008'>93. The teeth being so essential to health, the greatest
care should be taken of them: they should be
esteemed among one’s most precious possessions.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>94. With regard to <i>beverage</i>, there is, as a rule,
nothing better for dinner than either toast and water,
or, if it be preferred, plain spring water—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Naught like the simple element dilutes;”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>and after dinner, one or two glasses of sherry. A lady
sometimes, until she has had a glass of wine, cannot
eat her dinner; when such be the case, by all means
let a glass of wine be taken,—that is to say, let her
have it either just <i>before</i> or <i>during</i> dinner, instead of
<i>after</i> dinner; or let her have one glass of sherry <i>before</i>
or <i>during</i> dinner, and one glass <i>after</i> dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>95. A young wife sometimes has a languid circulation,
a weak digestion, and constipated bowels; then,
a glass of sherry <i>during</i> dinner and another glass <i>after</i>
dinner is beneficial; and however much she might dislike
wine, she should be induced to take it, as the wine
will improve her circulation, will strengthen her digestion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and will tend to open her bowels. But let me
urge her never, unless ordered by a medical man, to
exceed the two glasses of wine daily.</p>

<p class='c008'>96. If wine does not agree, and if she require a
stimulant, a tumblerful either of home-brewed ale or
of Burton bitter ale ought, instead of water, to be
taken at dinner. But remember, if she drink either
beer or porter, she must take a great deal of out-door
exercise; otherwise it will probably make her bilious.
If she be inclined to be bilious, wine is superior to
either beer or porter.</p>

<p class='c008'>91. Brandy ought never to be taken by a young
wife but as a medicine, and then but rarely, and only
in cases of extreme exhaustion. It would be a melancholy
and gloomy prospect for her to drink brandy
daily; she would, in all probability, in a short time
become a confirmed drunkard. There is nothing, <i>when
once regularly taken</i>, more fascinating and more desperately
dangerous than brandy-drinking. It has caused
the destruction of tens of thousands both of men and
of women!</p>

<p class='c008'>98. A wife ought not, if she feel low, to fly on every
occasion to wine to raise her spirits, but should try the
effects of a walk in the country, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Draw physic from the fields in <i>draughts</i> of vital air.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>99. An excitable wife is a weakly wife: “excitement
is the effect of weakness, not of strength.” Wine
in large quantities will not strengthen, but, on the
contrary, will decidedly weaken; the more the wine,
the greater the debility and the greater the excitement—one
follows the other as the night the day. A
person who drinks much wine is always in a state of
excitement, and is invariably weak, low, and nervous,
and frequently barren. Alcoholic stimulants in excess
are “a delusion and a snare,” and are one of the most
frequent causes of excitement, and therefore both of
weakness and of barrenness. Alcohol, pure and undiluted,
and in excess, is a poison, and is ranked among
the deadly poisons; if a person were to drink at one
draught half a pint of undiluted alcohol it would be
the last draught he or she would ever, in this world,
drink,—it would be as surely fatal as a large dose of
either arsenic or strychnine! Brandy, whisky, gin,
and wine are composed of alcohol as the principal ingredient;
indeed, each and all of them entirely owe
their strength to the quantity of alcohol contained
therein. Brandy, whisky, gin, and wine, without the
alcohol, would, each one of them, be as chip in porridge—perfectly
inert. Brandy and wine, the former especially,
contain large proportions of alcohol, and both
the one and the other, in excess, either prevents a
woman from conceiving, and thus makes her barren,
or if she do conceive, it poisons the unborn babe within
her; and it either makes him puny and delicate, or it
downright kills him in the womb, and thus causes a
miscarriage. If he survive the poison, and he be born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>alive, he is usually, when born, delicate and undersized;
if such a one be suckled by such a mother, he
is subjected, if the mother can nurse him, which in
such cases she rarely can, to a second course of poisoning;
the mother’s milk is poisoned with the alcohol,
and the poor unfortunate little wretch, having to run
the gantlet in the womb and out of the womb, pines
and dwindles away, until at length he finds a resting-place
in the grave! If you wish to make a dog small,
give him, when he is a puppy, gin; the alcohol of the
gin will readily do it: this is a well-known fact, and is,
by dog-fanciers, constantly practiced. If you desire,
in like manner, to make a Tom Thumb of a baby,
give him the milk of a mother or of a wet-nurse who
imbibes, in the form of wine or of brandy or of gin,
alcohol in quantities, and the deed is done! Gin-drinking
nursing mothers, it is well known, have
usually puny children; indeed, the mother drinking
the gin is only another way of giving gin to the babe—an
indirect instead of a direct route, both leading to
the same terminus. Brandy was formerly sold only
by the apothecary; brandy is a medicine—a powerful
medicine—and ought only to be prescribed as a medicine;
that is to say, but seldom, in small and in measured
quantities at a time, and only when absolutely
necessary: now it is resorted to on every occasion
as a panacea for every ill! If taken regularly, and in
quantities, as unfortunately it frequently now is, it becomes
a desperate poison—a pathway leading to the
grave! It is utterly impossible for any person to hold
in the mouth, for five minutes at a time, a mouthful of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>neat brandy without experiencing intense suffering: if
it has this fearful effect on the mouth, what effect must
this burning fluid, when taken in quantities, have upon
the stomach? Injury, most decided injury to the
stomach, and, through the stomach, disease and weakness
to the remainder of the body! Brandy is a wonderful
and powerful agent: brandy has the effect, if
taken in excess and for a length of time, of making the
liver as hard as a board. Brandy in large quantities,
and in the course of time, has the power of making
the body marvelously big—as big again; but not with
firm muscle and strong sinew, not with good blood and
wholesome juices—nothing of the kind; but of filling
it full, even to bursting, with water! Brandy has the
power of taking away a giant’s strength, and of making
him as helpless as a little child! Habitual brandy-drinking
poisons the very streams of life! It would
take more time and space than I have to spare to tell
of the wonderful powers of brandy; but unfortunately,
as a rule, its powers are more those of an angel of
darkness than those of an angel of light! If the above
statements be true (and they cannot be contravened),
they show the folly, the utter imbecility, and the danger,
both to mother and to babe, of dosing a wife, be
she strong or be she delicate, and more especially if
she be delicate, with large quantities either of wine
or of brandy. Brandy, gin, and whisky act on the
human economy very much alike; for, after all, it is the
quantity of alcohol contained in each of them that
gives them their real strength and danger. I have
selected brandy as the type of all of them, as brandy is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>now the fashionable remedy for all complaints, and, unfortunately,
in too many instances the habit of drinking
it imperceptibly but rapidly increases, until at
length, in many cases, that which was formerly a teaspoonful
becomes a tablespoonful, and eventually a
wineglassful, with what result I have earnestly endeavored
faithfully to portray. Avoid, then, the first
step in regular brandy-drinking: it is the first step
that ofttimes leads to danger, and eventually to destruction!</p>

<p class='c008'>100. I am quite convinced that one cause of barrenness
among ladies of the present day is <i>excessive</i> wine-drinking.
This is an age of stimulants, and the practice
is daily increasing. A delicate lady is recommended
to take three or four glasses of wine daily. It seems
for the moment to do her good, and whenever she feels
low she flies to it again. The consequence is, that she
almost lives upon wine, and takes but little else besides!
Who are the fruitful women? Poor women who cannot
afford to drink stimulants; for instance, poor Irish
women and poor curates’ wives, who have only, principally,
water and milk and buttermilk to drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>101. There is decidedly, among the higher ranks,
more barrenness than formerly, and one cause of it, in
my opinion, is the much larger quantity of wine
now consumed than in the olden times. Many ladies
now drink as many glasses of wine in one day as their
grandmothers drank in a week; moreover, the wineglasses
of the present day are twice the size of old-fashioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>wineglasses; so that half a dozen glasses of
wine will almost empty a bottle; and many ladies now
actually drink, in the day, half a dozen glasses of wine!</p>

<p class='c008'>102. In the wine-growing and wine-drinking country
of France, barrenness prevails to a fearful extent; it has
become there a serious consideration and a State question.
Wine is largely consumed in France by ladies
as well as by gentlemen. The usual and everyday
quantity of wine allowed <i>at</i> dinner at the <i>restaurants</i>
of Paris, for each lady, is half a wine quart bottle-full—a
similar quantity to that allowed for each gentleman.
Where a gentleman and a lady are dining together,
and have a bottle of wine between them, it is
probable that the former might consume more than his
own share of the wine; but whether he does or not,
the quantity the lady herself drinks is sadly too much
either for her health or for her fruitfulness. I am,
moreover, quite convinced that the quantity of wine—sour
wine—consumed by French wives is not only
very antagonistic to their fertility, but likewise to their
complexions.</p>

<p class='c008'>103. Wine was formerly a luxury, it is now made a
necessary of life. Fruitful women, in olden times, were
more common than they are now. Riches, and consequently
wine, did not then so much abound, but children
did much more abound. The richer the person,
the fewer the children.</p>

<p class='c008'>104. Wine is now oftentimes sucked in with a mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>milk! Do not let me be misunderstood; wine
and brandy, in certain cases of extreme exhaustion,
are, even for very young children, most valuable remedies;
but I will maintain that both wine and brandy
require the greatest judgment and skill in administering,
and do irreparable mischief unless they are most
carefully and judiciously prescribed. Wine ought to
be very rarely given to the young; indeed, it should
be administered to them with as much care and as
seldom as any other dangerous or potent medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>105. Statistics prove that wine-bibbing in England
is greatly on the increase, and so is barrenness. You
might say there is no connection between the two. I
maintain that there is a connection, and that, the alcohol
contained in the wine (<i>if wine be taken to excess,
which unfortunately it now frequently is</i>) is most antagonistic
to fruitfulness.</p>

<p class='c008'>106. It is surprising, nowadays, the quantity of
wine some few young single ladies, at parties, can imbibe
without being intoxicated; but whether, if such
ladies marry, they will make fruitful vines is quite another
matter; but of this I am quite sure, that such
girls will, as a rule, make delicate, hysterical, and unhealthy
wives. The young are peculiarly sensitive to
the evil effects of overstimulation. Excessive wine-drinking
with them is a canker eating into their very
lives. Time it is that these facts were proclaimed
through the length and breadth of our land, before
mischief be done past remedy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>107. Champagne is a fashionable and favorite beverage
at parties, especially at dances. It is a marvel to
note how girls will, in quantities, imbibe the dangerous
liquid. How cheerful they are after it; how bright
their colors; how sparkling their eyes; how voluble
their tongues; how brilliant their ideas! But, alas!
the effects are very evanescent—dark clouds soon o’ershadow
the horizon, and all is changed! How pale,
after it, they become; how sallow their complexions;
how dim their eyes; how silent their tongues; how
depressed their spirits—depression following in an inverse
ratio to overstimulation; and if depression, as
a matter of course, weakness and disease! Champagne
is one of the most fascinating but most desperately
dangerous and deceptive drinks a young girl
can imbibe, and should be shunned as the plague!
Young men who witness their proceedings admire
them vastly as partners for the evening, but neither
covet nor secure them as partners for life. Can they
be blamed? Certainly not! They well know that
girls who, at a dance, imbibe <i>freely</i> of the champagne-cup,
and who at a dinner party drink, as some few are
in the habit of drinking, four or five, or even six,
glasses of wine,—that such wives as these, if ever they
do become mothers (which is very doubtful), will be
mothers of a degenerate race. It is folly blinking the
question; it is absolutely necessary that it be looked
boldly in the face, and that the evil be remedied before
it be too late.</p>

<p class='c008'>108. There is an immense deal of drinking in England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>which, I am quite convinced, is one reason of so
few children in families, and of so many women being
altogether barren. It is high time that these subjects
were looked into, and that the torrent be stemmed, ere
it o’erflow its banks, and carry with it a still greater
amount of barrenness, of misery, and of destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>109. It might be said that the light wines contain
but little alcohol, and therefore can cause, even if taken
to excess, but slight injurious effects on the constitution.
I reply, that even light wines, taken in quantities,
conduce to barrenness, and that, as a rule, if a
lady once unfortunately takes to drinking too much
wine, she is not satisfied with the light wines, but at
length flies to stronger wines—to wines usually fortified
with brandy, such as either to sherry or to port
wine, or even, at last, to brandy itself! I know that
I am treading on tender ground, but my duty as a
medical man, and as a faithful chronicler of these matters,
obliges me to speak out plainly, without fear or
without favor, and to point out the deplorable consequences
of such practices. I am quite aware that
many ladies have great temptations and great inducements
to resort to wine to cheer them in their hours
of depression and of loneliness; but unless the danger
be clearly pointed out and defined, it is utterly impossible
to suggest a remedy, and to snatch such patients
from certain destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>110. I am quite convinced of one thing, namely, that
the drinking of <i>much</i> wine—be it light as claret, or be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>it heavy as port—sadly injures the complexion, and
makes it muddy, speckled, broken-out, and toad-like.</p>

<p class='c008'>111. It is high time that medical men should speak
out on the subject, and that with no “uncertain sound,”
before mischief be done past remedy, and before our
island become as barren of children as France unfortunately
now is.</p>

<p class='c008'>112. If a lady be laboring under debility, she is
generally dosed with quantities of wine—the greater
the debility the more wine she is made to take, until
at length the poor unfortunate creature almost lives
upon wine. Her appetite for food is by such means
utterly destroyed, and she is for a time kept alive by
stimulants; her stomach will at length take nothing
else, and she becomes a confirmed invalid, soon dropping
into an untimely grave! This is a most grievous,
and, unfortunately, in this country, not an uncommon
occurrence. Much wine will never make a delicate
lady strong—it will increase her weakness, not her
strength. Wine in excess does not strengthen, but,
on the contrary, produces extreme debility. Let this
be borne in mind, and much misery might then be
averted.</p>

<p class='c008'>113. Remember I am not objecting to a lady taking
wine in moderation—certainly not; a couple of glasses,
for instance, in the day, of either sherry or claret, might
do her great good; but I do strongly object to her
drinking, as many ladies do, five or six glasses of wine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>during that time. I will maintain that such a quantity
is most detrimental both to her health and to her fecundity.</p>

<p class='c008'>114. The effect of the <i>use</i> of wine is beneficial; but
the effect of the <i>abuse</i> of it is deplorable in the extreme.
Wine is an edge-tool, and will, if not carefully handled,
assuredly wound most unmercifully. I have not the
slightest doubt that the quantity of wine consumed by
many ladies is one cause, in this our day, of so much
delicacy of constitution. It is a crying evil, and demands
speedy redress; and as no more worthy medical
champion has appeared in the field to fight the
battle of <i>moderate</i> wine-drinking, I myself have boldly
come forward to commence the affray, fervently trusting
that some earnest men may join me in the conflict.
I consider that the advocates for a plentiful supply of
alcoholic stimulants are wrong, and that the upholders
of total abstinence principles are equally wrong; and
that the only path of health and of safety lies between
them both—in moderation. A teetotaller and an advocate
for a plentiful supply of alcoholic drinks are
both very difficult to please; indeed, the one and the
other are most intemperate. I am aware that what I
have written will be caviled at, and will give great
offense to both extreme parties; but I am quite prepared
and willing to abide the consequences, and sincerely
hope that what I have said will be the means
of ventilating the subject, which is sadly needed. It
is the violence and obstinacy of the contending parties,
each of whom is partly right and partly wrong, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>have long ago prevented a settlement of the question
at issue, and have consequently been the means of
causing much heart-burning, misery, and suffering.
The <cite>Times</cite> once pithily remarked that it would be
well if the two combatants were “to mix their liquors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>115. A young wife ought to rise betimes in the
morning, and after she be once awake should never
doze. Dozing is both weakening to the body and
enervating to the mind. It is a species of dram-drinking;
let my fair reader, therefore, shun it with all her
might. Let her imitate the example of <i>the</i> Duke of
Wellington, who, whenever he turned in bed, made a
point of turning out of it; indeed, so determined was
that illustrious man not to allow himself to doze after
he was once awake, that he had his bed made so small
that he could not conveniently turn in it without first
of all turning out of it. Let her, as soon as she is
married, commence early rising; let her establish the
habit, and it will for life cling to her:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Awake! the morning shines, and the fresh field</div>
      <div class='line'>Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring</div>
      <div class='line'>Our tender plants; how blows the citron grove,</div>
      <div class='line'>What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed;</div>
      <div class='line'>How Nature paints her colors; how the bee</div>
      <div class='line'>Sits on the bloom.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>116. It is wonderful how much may be done betimes
in the morning. There is nothing like a good start. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>makes for the remainder of the day the occupation easy
and pleasant—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Happy, thrice happy, every one</div>
      <div class='line'>Who sees his labor well begun,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>117. How glorious, and balmy, and health-giving,
is the first breath of the morning, more especially to
those living in the country! It is more exhilarating,
invigorating, and refreshing than it is all the rest of
the day. If you wish to be strong, if you desire to retain
your good looks and your youthful appearance, if
you are desirous of having a family, rise betimes in
the morning; if you are anxious to lay the foundation
of a long life, jump out of bed the moment you are
awake. Let there be no dallying, no parleying with
the enemy, or the battle is lost, and you will never
after become an early riser; you will then lose one of
the greatest charms and blessings of life, and will,
probably, not have the felicity of ever becoming a
mother; if you do become one, it will most likely be
of puny children. The early risers make the healthy,
bright, long-lived wives and mothers. But if a wife is
to be an early riser, she must have a little courage
and determination; great advantages in this world are
never gained without; but what is either man or woman
good for if they have not those qualities?</p>

<p class='c008'>118. An early riser ought always to have something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to eat and drink, such as a little bread and butter, and
either a cup of tea or a draught of new milk, before she
goes out of a morning; this need not interfere with,
at the usual hour, her regular breakfast. If she were
to take a long walk on an empty stomach, she would
for the remainder of the day feel tired and exhausted,
and she would then, but most unfairly, fancy that early
rising did not agree with her.</p>

<p class='c008'>119. The early morning is one of the best and most
enjoyable portions of the day. There is a perfect
charm in nature which early risers alone can appreciate.
It is only the early riser that ever sees “the
rosy morn,” the blushing of the sky, which is gloriously
beautiful! Nature, in the early morning, seems to rejoice
and be glad, and to pour out her richest treasures:
the birds vie with each other in their sweetest carols;
the dew on the grass, like unto myriads of diamonds,
glittering and glistening, and glinting in the rays of
the sun; occasionally the cobwebs on the shrubs and
bushes, like exquisite lace sparkling with gems; the
fresh and matchless perfume and fragrance of the earth
and flowers;—these, one and all, are gloriously beautiful
to behold, and can only be enjoyed to perfection
in the early morning, while the majority of people,
during the choicest periods of their existence, are
sweltering, and dozing, and deteriorating both in body
and mind, on beds of down, when they ought to be
up, out, and about! Can it be wondered at, when such
weakening and enervating practices are so much in
vogue—for luxury is the curse of the day—that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>are so many barren wives in England? It looks, on
the first blush, that many of the customs and practices
of the present day were to cause barrenness; for, assuredly,
if they had been instituted on purpose, they
could not have performed their task more surely and
successfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>120. It might be said that the dews of the morning
are dangerous! The dews of the early morning are
beneficial to health, while the dews of the evening are
detrimental. How truly the poet sings—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dew-drops are the gems of morning,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the tears of mournful eve!”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>121. Early rising imparts health to the frame,
strength to the muscles, and comeliness to the countenance;
it clears the brain, and thus brightens the
intellect; it is a panacea for many of the ills of life,
and, unlike many panaceas, it is both simple and
pleasant in its operation; it calms the troubled breast;
it gives a zest to the after-employments and pleasures
of the day; and makes both man and woman look up
from “nature’s works to nature’s God!”</p>

<p class='c008'>122. Early rising rejuvenizes the constitution: it
makes the middle-aged look young, and the old look
middle-aged; it is the finest cosmetic in the world, and
tints the cheeks with a bloom the painter emulates,
but in vain! On the other hand, late rising adds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>years to the looks, fills the body with aches and pains,
and the countenance with crow-feet and wrinkles;
gives a yellowness and pimples to the face, and depression
to the spirits. Aged looks and ill health
invariably follow in the wake of late rising.</p>

<p class='c008'>123. If a mistress rise early the servants are likely
to follow suit: a lazy mistress is almost sure to have
lazy servants; the house becomes a sluggard’s dwelling!
Do not let me be misunderstood; I do not recommend
any unreasonable hours for rising in the
morning; I do not advise a wife to rise early for the
sake of rising early: there would be neither merit nor
sense in it; I wish her to have her full complement of
sleep—seven or eight hours; but I do advise her <i>to go
to bed early</i>, in order that she might be up every morning
at six o’clock in the summer, and at seven o’clock
in the winter. I maintain that it is the <i>duty</i> of every
wife, unless prevented by illness, to be an early riser.
This last reason should have greater weight with her
than any other that can possibly be brought forward!
All things in this world ought to be done from a sense
of duty; duty ought to be a wife’s and every other
person’s pole-star!</p>

<p class='c008'>124. There is a wonderful and glorious object in
creation which few, very few, ladies, passing strange
though it be, have ever seen—the rising of the sun!
The few who have seen it are, probably, those who
have turned night into day, who are returning home
in the early morning, jaded and tired, after dancing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>whole of the previous night. These, of course, cannot
enjoy, and most likely do not even see, the magnificent
spectacle!</p>

<p class='c008'>125. I am not advising my fair reader to rise every
morning with the rising of the sun—certainly not;
but if she be an early riser, she might occasionally indulge
herself in beholding the glorious sight!</p>

<p class='c008'>126. “The top of the morning to you” is a favorite
Irish salutation, and is very expressive and complimentary.
“The top of the morning”—the early morning,
the time when the sun first rises in his majesty and
splendor—is the most glorious, and health-giving, and
best part of the whole day; when nature and all
created beings rejoice and are glad:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But mighty Nature bounds as from her birth,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sun is in the heavens, and life on earth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Flowers in the valley, splendor in the beam,</div>
      <div class='line'>Health in the gale, and freshness in the stream.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>127. Let a young wife, if she be anxious to have a
family and healthy progeny, be in bed betimes. It is
impossible that she can rise early in the morning unless
she retire early at night. “One hour’s sleep before
midnight is worth three after.” Sleep before midnight
is most essential to health, and if to health, to beauty;
hence, sleep before midnight is called <i>beauty-sleep</i>.
The finest cosmetic is health!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>128. She ought to pay particular attention to the <i>ventilation</i>
of her sleeping apartment, and she herself, before
leaving the chamber in the morning, ought never
to omit to open the windows; and in the summer, if
the room be large, she should during the night leave,
for about six or eight inches, the window-sash open.
If the room be small it will be desirable to have, instead
of the window, the door (secured from intrusion
by a door-chain) unclosed; and to have, as well, either
the skylight or the landing window open. There ought
by some means or other, if the inmates of the room
are to have sweet and refreshing sleep, to be thorough
ventilation of the sleeping apartment. I have no patience
to hear some men assert that it is better to sleep
in a close room—in a foul room! They might, with equal
truth, declare that it is desirable for a healthy person to
swallow every night a dose of arsenic in order to prolong
his life! Carbonic acid gas is as truly a poison as
arsenic! If there be a dressing-room next to the bedroom,
it will be well to have the dressing-room window,
instead of the bedroom window, open at night. The
dressing-room door will regulate the quantity of air to
be admitted into the bedroom, opening it either little
or much as the weather might be cold or otherwise.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
The idea that it will give cold is erroneous; it will be
more likely, by strengthening the system and by carrying
off the impurities of the lungs and skin, to prevent
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>129. Some persons, accustomed all their lives to
sleep in a close, foul room—in a room contaminated
with carbonic acid gas—cannot sleep in a fresh, well-ventilated
chamber, in a chamber with either door or
window open: they seem to require the stupefying
effects of the carbonic acid gas, and cannot sleep without
it! If such be the case, and as sleep is of such
vital importance to the human economy, let both window
and door be closed, but do not, on any account,
let the chimney be stopped, as there must be, in a bedroom,
ventilation of some kind or another, or ill health
will inevitably ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>130. It is madness to sleep in a room without ventilation—<i>it
is inhaling poison</i>; for the carbonic acid
gas, the refuse of respiration, which the lungs are constantly
throwing off, is a poison—a deadly poison—and,
of course, if there be no ventilation, a person must
breathe this carbonic acid gas mixed with the atmospheric
air. Hence the importance, the vital importance,
of either an <i>open</i> chimney or of an <i>open</i> window,
or of both. The chimney, then, even if the window
be closed, ought <i>never</i> to be stopped; and the window,
either of the bedroom or of the dressing-room, should
not be closed, even in the night, unless the weather be
either very wet or bitterly cold. I should strongly
recommend my fair reader, and, indeed, every one else,
to peruse the good and talented Florence Nightingale’s
<cite>Notes on Nursing</cite>. They ought to be written in letters
of gold, and should be indelibly impressed on the memory
of every one who has the interest of human life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and happiness at heart. Florence Nightingale declares
<i>that no one, while in bed, ever catches cold from proper
ventilation</i>. I believe her; and I need not say that no
one has had more experience and better opportunities
of judging about what she writes than this accomplished
authoress.</p>

<p class='c008'>131. I fearlessly assert that no one can sleep sweetly
and refreshingly unless there be <i>thorough</i> ventilation
of the chamber. She may have, in an <i>unventilated</i>
apartment, heavy, drowsy, deathlike sleep, and well
she might! She is under the stupefying effects of
poison; the carbonic acid gas, which is constantly
being evolved from the lungs, and which wants a vent,
but cannot obtain it, is, as I have before remarked,
a <i>deadly poison</i>! She may as well take every night
a stupefying opiate, as breathe nightly a bedroom
charged with carbonic acid gas; the one would, in the
long run, be as pernicious as the other. To show the
power of carbonic acid gas in sending people to sleep,
we have only to notice a crowded church of an evening;
when, even if the preacher be an eloquent man,
the majority of the congregation is fast asleep,—is, in
point of fact, under the soporific influence of the carbonic
acid gas, the church being at the time full of it.
Carbonic acid gas is as certain, if not more certain, to
produce a heavy deathlike slumber as either numbing
opium or drowsy poppy.</p>

<p class='c008'>132. I moreover declare that she cannot have sweet
refreshing sleep at night unless during the day she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>take plenty of exercise, and unless she has an abundance
of active, useful occupation.</p>

<p class='c008'>133. Occupation—active, useful occupation—is the
best composing medicine in the world; and the misfortune
of it is that the wealthy have little or no occupation
to cause them to sleep. Pleasure they have in
abundance, but little or no real occupation. “The
sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little
or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer
them to sleep.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>134. Sleep is of more consequence to the human
economy than food. Nothing should therefore be allowed
by a young wife to interfere with sleep. And
as the attendance on large assemblies, balls, and concerts
sadly, in every way, interfere with sleep, they
ought, one and all, to be sedulously avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>135. As exercise is very conducive and provocative
of sleep—sound, sweet, childlike sleep—exercise must
be practiced, and that not by fits and starts, but regularly
and systematically. She ought, then, during the
day, with exercise and with occupation, to tire herself,
and she will then have sweet and refreshing sleep.
But some ladies never do tire themselves except with
excitement; they do not know what it is to be tired
either by a long walk or by household work. They
can tire themselves with dancing at a ball; poor fragile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>creatures can remain up the whole night waltzing,
quadrilling, and galloping, but would be shocked at the
idea and at the vulgarity of walking a mile at a stretch!
Poor creatures, they are to be pitied; and, if they ever
marry, so are their husbands. Are such wives as these
likely to be mothers, and if they are, are their offspring
likely to be strong? Are such wives as these likely to
be the mothers of our future warriors, of our future
statesmen, and of our other worthies—men of mark,
who,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

      <div class='line in4'>“Departing, leave behind them</div>
      <div class='line'>Footprints on the sands of time!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>136. Sleep is the choicest gift of God. Sleep is a
comforter, a solace, a boon, a nourisher, a friend.
Happy, thrice happy, is a wife who can sleep like
unto a little child! When she is well, what a comfort
is sleep; when she is ill, what a soother of pain is
sleep; when she is in trouble, what a precious balm is
sleep!</p>

<p class='c008'>137. Hear what our noblest poet, Shakspeare, says
of sleep:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care,</div>
      <div class='line'>The death of each day’s life, sore labor’s bath,</div>
      <div class='line'>Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course</div>
      <div class='line'>Chief nourisher in life’s feast.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>138. A luxurious, idle wife cannot sleep; she, night
after night, tumbles and tosses on her bed of down.
What has she done during the day to tire herself, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>thus to induce sleep? Alas, nothing! She in consequence
never experiences</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tired nature’s sweet restorer, balmy sleep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>For, after all, out-door exercise and useful occupation
are the best composing medicines in the world! Encompassed
as she is with every luxury—partaking of
all the delicacies of the season, of the richest viands,
and of the choicest wines—decked out in costly apparel—reclining
on the softest cushions—surrounded
with exquisite scenery, with troops of friends, and
with bevies of servants;—yet, notwithstanding all
these apparent advantages, she is oftentimes one of the
most debilitated, complaining, “nervous,” hysterical
and miserable of mortals. The <i>causes</i> of all these afflictions
are—she has nothing to do; she is overwhelmed
with prosperity; she is like a fire that is being extinguished
in consequence of being overloaded with fuel;
she is being killed with overmuch kindness; she is a
drone in a hive where <i>all</i> must work if they are to be
strong and well, and bright and cheerful; for labor is
the lot of <i>all</i> and the law for <i>all</i>, for “God is no respecter
of persons.” The <i>remedies</i> for a lady affected
as above described are simple and yet efficacious—namely,
simplicity of living, and an abundance of out-door
exercise and of useful occupation. It would have
been to the manifest advantage of many a fair dame if
she were obliged to put down her close carriage, and
were compelled to walk instead of drive. Riding in
close carriages nurse many ailments which walking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>would banish; a brisk walk is the best tonic and the
most reviving medicine in the world, and would prevent
the necessity of her swallowing so much nauseous
physic. Nature’s simple remedies are oftentimes far
superior and far more agreeable than any to be found
in the Pharmacopœia. It would have been a blessing
to many a rich, indolent, and luxurious lady if she had
been born in a lower rank—in one in which she had
been compelled to work for her daily bread; if she had
been, she would, in many instances, have been far happier
and healthier than she now is. Indolence and
luxury kill more than hard work and hard fare ever did
or ever will kill. Indolence and luxury are slow
poisons; they destroy by degrees, but are in the end
as certain in their deleterious effects as either arsenic
or deadly nightshade—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come hither, ye that press your beds of down,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sleep not; see him sweating o’er his bread</div>
      <div class='line'>Before he eats it. ’Tis the primal curse,</div>
      <div class='line'>But softened into mercy—made the pledge</div>
      <div class='line'>Of cheerful days, and nights without a groan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>139. I must not forget to speak of the paramount
importance in a dwelling of an abundance of <i>light</i>—of
<i>daylight</i>. Light is life, light is health, light is a physician!
Light is life: the sun gives life as well as light;
if it were not for the sun, all creation would wither
and die. There is “no vitality or healthful structure
without light.”<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Light is health: it strengthens the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>frame, it cheers the heart, and tints the cheeks with a
roseate hue! Light is a physician: it drives away
many diseases, as the mists vanish at the approach of
the sun; and it cures numerous ailments which drugs
alone are unable to relieve.</p>

<p class='c008'>140. Look at the bloom on the face of a milkmaid!
What is it that tints her cheeks? An abundance of
light. Behold the pallid, corpselike countenance of a
factory girl! What blanches her cheek? The want of
light, of air, and of sunshine.</p>

<p class='c008'>141. A room, then, ought to have <i>large</i> windows
in order that the sun might penetrate into every nook
and corner of the apartment. A gardener thoroughly
appreciates the importance of light to his flowers; he
knows, also, that if he wishes to blanch some kinds of
vegetables—such as celery and sea-kale—he must keep
the light from them; and if my fair reader desires to
blanch her own cheeks, she ought to keep the light
from them; but, on the other hand, if she be anxious
to be healthy and rosy, she must have plenty of light
in her dwelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>142. The want of light stunts the growth, dims the
sight, and damps the spirits. Colliers, who a great
part of their lives live in the bowels of the earth, are
generally stunted; prisoners, confined for years in a
dark dungeon, frequently become blind; people who
live in dark houses are usually melancholic.</p>

<p class='c008'>143. Light banishes from rooms foulness, fustiness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>mustiness, and smells. Light ought therefore to be
freely allowed to enter every house, and be esteemed
as the most welcome of visitors. Let me then advise
every young wife to admit into her dwelling an abundance
of light, of air, and of sunshine.</p>

<p class='c008'>144. Some ladies, to keep off the sun, to prevent it
from fading the furniture, have, in the summer time,
all the blinds of the windows of the house down.
Hence they save the fading of their furniture, and, instead
of which, they fade their own and their children’s
cheeks. Many houses, with all their blinds down, look
like so many prisons, or as if the inmates were in deep
affliction, or as if they were performing penance; for is
it not a penance to be deprived of the glorious light of
day, which is as exhilarating to the spirits as, and
much more beneficial than, a glass of champagne?</p>

<p class='c008'>145. It is a grievous sin to keep out from a dwelling
the glorious sunshine. We have heard of “a trap to
catch a sunbeam:” let the open windows be a trap,
and a more desirable prize cannot be caught than a
sunbeam. Sunbeams, both physical and metaphorical,
make a house a paradise upon earth!</p>

<p class='c008'>146. Let me strongly caution the newly made wife
against the evil effects of <i>tight lacing</i>. The waist
ought, as a rule, to be from twenty-seven to twenty-nine
inches in circumference; if, therefore, she bind
and gird herself in until she be only twenty-three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>inches, and, in some cases, until she be only twenty-one
inches, it must be done at the expense of comfort, of
health, and happiness. If stays be worn tightly, they
press down the contents of the lower part of the belly,
which might either prevent a lady from having a family,
or might produce a miscarriage.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>147. Let her dress be loose, and be adapted to the
season. She ought not to adopt the fashion of wearing
in the morning warm clothes with long sleeves,
and in the evening thin dresses with short sleeves.
“It is hopeless to battle with fashion in matters of
dress; women will never believe that their bonnets,
neck-wrappers, or huge petticoats (until they go out of
fashion) can have anything to do with headaches, sore
throats, or rheumatism; but they ought to know that
the more they swathe themselves, the more tender and
delicate they are likely to be. If they wish to withstand
cold, they should accustom themselves to bear
it.”<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>148. If a young wife be delicate, and if her circulation
be languid, a flannel vest next the skin, and in the
daytime, should, winter and summer, be worn. Scarlet
is, in such a case, a favorite color, and may be selected
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>149. It is important that it should be borne in mind
that the wearing of flannel next the skin is more necessary
in the summer than in the winter time. A lady
in the summer is apt, when hot, either from the weather
or from exertion, to get into a draught to cool herself,
and not wearing flannel next the skin, she is almost
sure at such times to catch a cold. Now, flannel being
a bad conductor of heat, keeps the body at a tolerably
equal temperature, and thus materially lessens the
risk. When it is considered that many of the diseases
afflicting humanity arise from colds, the value of wearing
flannel next the skin as a preventive is at once apparent.</p>

<p class='c008'>150. Never was there such a time as the present
when dress was so much thought of. Grand dresses
now sweep our dirty streets and thoroughfares; rich
velvets, silks, and satins are as plentiful as dead leaves
in autumn. “There is so much to gaze and stare at in
the dress, one’s eyes are quite dazzled and weary, and
can hardly pierce through to that which is clothed
upon.” Dress is become a crying evil; many ladies
clothe themselves in gorgeous apparel at the expense
of household comforts, and even of household necessaries:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“We sacrifice to dress, till household joys</div>
      <div class='line'>And comforts cease. Dress drains our cellars dry,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keeps our larder lean—puts out our fires,</div>
      <div class='line'>And introduces hunger, frost, and woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where peace and hospitality might reign.”<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>151. It might be said, What has all this to do with
the health of a wife? I reply, much. The customs,
habits, and luxuries of the present day are very antagonistic
both to health and fecundity.</p>

<p class='c008'>152. She must not coddle, nor should she muffle up
her throat with furs. Boas are the most frequent cause
of sore throats and quinsies, and therefore the sooner
they are discarded the better. “And this is perfectly
true, though few seem to be aware of the fact. Relaxed
throats would be rare if cold water was more plentifully
used, both externally and internally, and mufflers were
laid aside.”<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>153. If my gentle reader will freely use <i>cold</i> water
ablutions, she will find that she will not require nearly
so much clothing and muffling up. It is those who use
so <i>little</i> water who have to wear so <i>much</i> clothing;
and the misfortune of it is, the more clothes they
wear the more they require. Many young people
are wrapped and muffled up in the winter time like
old folks, and by coddling they become prematurely
old—frightened at a breath of air and at a shower of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>rain, and shaking in their shoes at an easterly wind!
Should such things be?</p>

<p class='c008'>154. Pleasure, to a certain degree, is as necessary
to the health of a young wife, and every one else, as
the sun is to the earth—to warm, to cheer, and to invigorate
it, and to bring out its verdure. Pleasure, in
moderation, rejuvenizes, humanizes, and improves the
character, and expands and exercises the good qualities
of the mind; but, like the sun, in its intensity it oppresseth
drieth up, and withereth. Pleasures kept
within due bounds are good, but in excess are utterly
subversive of health and happiness. A wife who lives
in a whirl of pleasure and excitement is always weakly
and “nervous,” and utterly unfitted for her duties and
responsibilities.</p>

<p class='c008'>155. Let the <i>pleasures</i> of a newly-married wife,
then, be dictated by reason, and not by fashion. She
ought to avoid all recreations of an exciting kind, as
depression always follows excitement. I would have
her prefer the amusements of the country to those of
the town, such as a flower-garden, botany, archery, croquet,
bowls,—everything, in fact, that will take her
into the open air, and will cause her to appreciate the
pure, simple, and exquisite beauties of nature. Croquet
I consider to be one of the best games ever invented:
it induces a lady to take exercise which perhaps
she would not otherwise do; it takes her into the
open air, it strengthens her muscles, it expands her
chest, it promotes digestion, it circulates her blood, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>it gives her an interest in the game which is most beneficial
both to mind and body.</p>

<p class='c008'>156. Oh, that my countrywomen should prefer
the contaminated and foul air of ball and of concert-rooms,
to the fresh, sweet, and health-giving air of the
country!</p>

<p class='c008'>157. Let me in this place enter my strong protest
against a young wife <i>dancing</i>, more especially if she
be <i>enceinte</i>. If she be anxious to have a family, it is
a most dangerous amusement, as it is a fruitful source
of miscarriage; and the misfortune is, that if she once
have a miscarriage, she might go on again and again,
until her constitution be severely injured, and until all
hopes of her ever becoming a mother are at an end.</p>

<p class='c008'>158. The quiet retirement of her own home ought
then to be her greatest pleasure and her most precious
privilege. Home is, or ought to be, the kingdom of
woman, and she should be the reigning potentate.
England is the only place in the world that truly
knows what <i>home</i> really means. The French have
actually no word in their language to express its
meaning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That home, the sound we English love so well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has been as strange to me as to those nations</div>
      <div class='line'>That have no word, they tell me, to express it.”<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>159. Cheerfulness, contentment, occupation, and
healthy activity of mind cannot be too strongly recommended.
A cheerful, happy temper is one of the most
valuable attributes a wife can have. The possession of
such a virtue not only makes herself, but every one
around her, happy. It gilds with sunshine the humblest
dwelling, and often converts an indifferent husband
into a good one. Contentment is the finest
medicine in the world; it not only frequently prevents
disease, but, if disease be present, it assists in curing
it. Happy is the man who has a contented wife! A
peevish, discontented helpmate (helpmate, save the
mark!) is always ailing, is never satisfied, and does
not know, and does not deserve to know, what real
happiness is. She is “a thorn in the flesh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>160. One of the greatest requisites, then, for a happy
home is a cheerful, contented, bright, and merry wife;
her face is a perpetual sunshine, her presence is that
of an angel; she is happy in herself, and she imparts
happiness to all around her. A gentle, loving, confiding,
placid, hopeful, and trusting disposition has a
great charm for a husband, and ought, by a young wife,
to be assiduously cultivated—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For gentleness, and love, and trust</div>
      <div class='line'>Prevail o’er angry wave and gust.”<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>161. Every young wife, let her station be ever so
exalted, ought to attend to her <i>household duties</i>. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>health, and consequently her happiness, demand the
exertion. The want of occupation—healthy, useful occupation—is
a fruitful source of discontent, of sin,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a> of
disease, and barrenness. If a young married lady did
but know the importance of occupation—how much
misery might be averted, and how much happiness
might, by attending to her household duties, be insured—she
would appreciate the importance of the advice.
Occupation improves the health, drives away <i>ennui</i>,
cheers the hearth and home, and, what is most important,
if household duties be well looked after, her house
becomes a paradise, and she the ministering angel to
her husband. But she might say—I cannot always be
occupied; it bores me; it is like a common person: I
am a lady; I was not made to work; I have neither
the strength nor the inclination for it; I feel weak and
tired, nervous and spiritless, and must have rest. I
reply, in the expressive words of the poet, that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Absence of occupation is not rest,—</div>
      <div class='line'>A mind quite vacant is a mind distress’d.”<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“If time be heavy on your hands,” are there no household
duties to look after, no servants to instruct, no
flower-beds to arrange, no school children to teach, no
sick-room to visit, no aged people to comfort, no widow
nor orphan to relieve?—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Nor any poor about your lands?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! teach the orphan boy to read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or teach the orphan girl to sew—</div>
      <div class='line'>Pray Heaven for a human heart.”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>162. To have nothing to do is most wretched, wearisome,
and destructive to the mind. The words of
Martin Luther on this subject should be written in
letters of gold, and ought to be kept in constant remembrance
by every man and woman, be they rich or poor,
lettered or unlettered, gentle or simple. “The mind,”
said he, “is like a mill that cannot stop working; give
it something to grind, and it will grind <i>that</i>. If it has
nothing to grind, it grinds on yet, but it is itself it
grinds and wears away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>163. A lady in this enlightened age of ours considers
it to be horribly low and vulgar to strengthen her loins
with exercise and her arms with occupation, although
such a plan of procedure is recommended in the Bible
by the wisest of men,—“She girdeth her loins with
strength, and strengthened her arms.”<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>164. A husband soon becomes tired of grand performances
on the piano, of crotchet and worsted work, and of
other fiddle-faddle employments; but he can always
appreciate a comfortable, clean, well-ordered, bright,
cheerful, happy home, and a good dinner. It might be
said that a wife is not the proper person to cook her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>husband’s dinner. True; but a wife should see and
know that the cook does her duty; and if she did, perchance,
understand <i>how</i> the dinner ought to be cooked,
I have yet to learn that the husband would for such
knowledge think any the worse of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>165. A grazing farmer is three or four years in
bringing a beast to perfection, fit for human food. Is
it not a sin, after so much time and pains, for an idiot
of a cook, in the course of one short hour or two, to
ruin, by vile cookery, a joint of such meat? Is it not
time, then, that a wife herself should know how a joint
of meat ought to be cooked, and thus to be able to give
instructions accordingly?</p>

<p class='c008'>166. A boy is brought up to his profession, and is
expected to know it thoroughly; how is it that a girl
is not brought up to her profession of a wife; and why
is it that she is not taught to thoroughly understand
all household duties? The daughters of a gentleman’s
family in olden time spent an hour or two every morning
in the kitchen and in the laundry, and were initiated
into the mysteries of pastry and pudding-making, of
preserving fruit, of ironing, etc. Their mothers’ and
their grandmothers’ receipt-books were at their finger-ends.
But now look at the picture; the daughters of
a gentleman’s family of the present day consider it very
low and horridly vulgar to understand any such matters.
It is just as absurd to ask a lady to play on the
piano who has never been taught music as to ask a
wife to direct her servants to perform duties which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>herself knows nothing about. The duties of a wife
cannot come either by intuition or by instinct more
than music can. Again I say, every lady, before she
be married, ought to be thoroughly taught her profession—the
duties of a wife; she then would not be at
the tender mercies of her servants, many of whom are
either unprincipled or inefficient.</p>

<p class='c008'>167. Do not think that I am overstating the importance
of the subject. A good dinner—I mean a well-cooked
dinner (which, be it ever so plain, is really a
good dinner)—is absolutely essential to the health, to
the very existence of yourself and your husband; and
how, if it be left to the tender mercies of the present
race of cooks, can you have it? High time it is that
every wife, let her station be either high or low, should
look into the matter herself, and remedy the crying
evil of the day. They manage these things better in
Sweden. There the young ladies of wealthy families
cook—actually themselves cook—the dinners; and instead
of their considering it a disgrace, and to be horridly
low and vulgar, they look upon it as one of their
greatest privileges! And what is the consequence?
A badly-cooked dinner is rare, and not, as it frequently
is in this country, of frequent occurrence; and “peace
and happiness” reign triumphant. It is a pity, too,
that we do not take a leaf out of the book of our neighbors
the French. Every woman in France is a good
cook; good cookery with them is the rule—with us it
is the exception. A well-cooked dinner is a blessing
to all who partake of it; it promotes digestion, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>sweetens the temper, it cheers the hearth and home.
There is nothing tries the temper more than an ill-cooked
dinner; it makes people dyspeptic, and for a
dyspeptic to be sweet-tempered is an utter impossibility.
Let me, therefore, advise my fair reader to
look well into the matter; either the gloom or the sunshine
of a house much depends upon herself and upon
her household management. It might be said—What
a poor creature a man must be to require so much attention.
Truly, if his health be not looked after, if
his comforts be not attended to, he is indeed a poor
creature!</p>

<p class='c008'>168. Every young wife should be able—ought to be
instructed by her mother or by some competent person—it
should be a part of her education—to teach and to
train her own servants aright. Unfortunately, in the
present day there is too much cant and humbug about
the instruction of the lower orders, and domestic servants
among the rest. They are instructed in many
things that are perfectly useless to them, the knowledge
of which only makes them dissatisfied with their lot
and tends to make them bad servants. Among other
useless subjects taught them are the “ologies.” It
would be much more to the purpose if they were thoroughly
instructed in all household duties, and “in the
three R’s—reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic,”—in obedience
to their mistresses, and in simplicity of demeanor
and dress. The servants themselves would be immensely
benefited by such lessons.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>169. A “blue-stocking” makes, as a rule, a wretched
wife; it would be far better for the health of her husband,
of herself, and her family, if, instead of cultivating
Latin and Greek, she would cultivate her household
duties, more especially a thorough knowledge of the
culinary department. “A man is, in general, better
pleased when he has a good dinner upon his table than
when his wife speaks Greek.”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>170. As soon as a lady marries, the romantic nonsense
of school-girls will rapidly vanish, and the stern
realities of life will take their place, and she will then
know, and sometimes to her grievous cost, that a <i>useful</i>
wife will be thought much more of than either an
<i>ornamental</i> or a <i>learned</i> one.</p>

<p class='c008'>171. It is better for a young wife, and for every one
else, to have too much than too little occupation. The
misfortune of the present day is, that servants are made
to do <i>all</i> the work, while the mistress of the house remains
idle. Remains idle! Yes; and by remaining
idle, remains out of health! Idleness is a curse, and
brings misery in its train! How slow the hours crawl
on when a person has nothing to do; but how rapidly
they fly when she is fully occupied! Besides, idleness
is a frequent cause of barrenness. Hard-worked, industrious
women are prolific; while idle ladies are frequently
childless, or, if they do have a family, their
children are puny, and their labors are usually both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>hard and lingering. We doctors know full well the
difference there often is between the labor of a poor
hard-worked woman and of a rich, idle lady: in the
one case the labor is usually quick and easy; in the
other, it is often hard and lingering. Oh, if wives
would consider betimes the importance of an abundance
of exercise and of occupation, what an immense amount
of misery, of pain, of anxiety, and anguish they might
avert! Work is a blessed thing; if we do not work
we pay the penalty—we suffer “in mind, body, and estate.”
An idle man or an idle woman is an object of
the deepest pity and commiseration.</p>

<p class='c008'>172. Longfellow, in his <i>Song of the Blacksmith</i>,
beautifully and graphically describes the importance
and the value of occupation; and as occupation is as
necessary to a woman as to a man, I cannot resist transcribing
it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Toiling—rejoicing—sorrowing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Onward through life he goes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Each morning sees some task begin,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Each evening sees its close;</div>
      <div class='line'>Something attempted, something done,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Has earned a night’s repose.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>173. Truly may it be said that “occupation earns a
night’s repose.” It is the finest composing medicine in
the world, and, unlike an opiate, it never gives a headache;
it never produces costiveness; and never, by
repetition, loses its effect. Sloth and restlessness, even
on down, are generally bed-fellows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“Weariness</div>
      <div class='line'>Can snore upon the flint, when rusty sloth</div>
      <div class='line'>Finds the down pillow hard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>174. The mind, it is well known, exerts great influence
over the body in promoting health, and in causing
and in curing disease. A delicate woman is always
nervous; she is apt to make mountains of molehills;
she is usually too prone to fancy herself worse
than she really is. I should recommend my gentle
reader not to fall into this error, and not to magnify
every slight ache or pain. Let her, instead of whining
and repining, use the means which are within the reach
of all to strengthen her frame; let her give battle to
the enemy; let her fight him with the simple weapons
indicated in these pages, and the chances are she will
come off victorious.</p>

<p class='c008'>175. There is nothing like occupation, active occupation,
to cure slight pains—“constant occupation
physics pain”—to drive away little ailments, and the
dread of sickness. “The dread of sickness,” says Dr.
Grosvenor, “is a distemper of itself, and the next disposition
to a many more. What a bondage does this
keep some people in! ’Tis an easy transition from the
fear and fancy of being sick to sickness indeed. In
many cases there is but little difference between those
two. There is one so afraid of being ill that he would
not stir out of doors, and for want of air and exercise
he contracts a distemper that kills him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>176. What a blessed thing is work! What a precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>privilege for a girl to have a mother who is both
able and anxious to instruct her daughter, from her
girlhood upwards, in all household management and
duties! Unfortunately, in this our age girls are not
either educated or prepared to be made wives—useful,
domesticated wives. Accomplishments they have
without number, but of knowledge of the management
of an establishment they are as ignorant as the babe
unborn. Verily, they and their unfortunate husbands
and offspring will in due time pay the penalty of their
ignorance and folly! It is, forsooth, unladylike for a
girl to eat much; it is unladylike for her to work at all;
it is unladylike for her to take a long walk; it is unladylike
for her to go into the kitchen; it is unladylike
for her to make her own bed; it is unladylike for her
to be useful; it is unladylike for her to have a bloom
upon her cheek like unto a milkmaid!<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> All these are
said to be horridly low and vulgar, and to be only fit
for the common people! Away with such folly! The
system of the bringing up of the young ladies of the
present day is “rotten to the core.”</p>

<p class='c008'>177. If a young married lady, without having any
actual disease about her, be delicate and nervous, there
is no remedy equal in value to change of air—more
especially to the sea-coast. The sea breezes, and, if
she be not pregnant, sea-bathing, frequently act like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>magic upon her in restoring her to perfect health. I
say, if she be not pregnant; if she be, it would, without
first obtaining the express permission of a medical
man, be highly improper for her to bathe.</p>

<p class='c008'>178. A walk on the mountains is delightful to the
feelings and beneficial to the health. In selecting a
sea-side resort, it is always, where it be practicable, to
have mountain-air as well as the sea breeze. The
mounting of high hills, if a lady be pregnant, would
not be desirable, as the exertion would be too great,
and, if she be predisposed, might bring on a miscarriage;
but the climbing of hills and mountains, if she
be not <i>enceinte</i>, is most advantageous to health, strengthening
the frame, and exhilarating to the spirits. Indeed,
we may compare the exhilaration it produces to
the drinking of champagne, with this difference,—it is
much more beneficial to health than champagne, and
does not leave, the next morning, as champagne sometimes
does, either a disagreeable taste in the mouth or
headache behind,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, there is a sweetness in the mountain-air,</div>

<p class='c008'>179. <i>Bugs and fleas.</i>—This is a very commonplace
subject, but like most commonplace subjects is one
necessary to be known, as these pests of society sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>destroy the peace, comfort, and enjoyment of a
person when away from home. Many ladies who
travel from home are made miserable and wretched by
having to sleep in strange beds—in beds infested either
with bugs or with fleas. Now, it will be well for such
ladies never to go any distance from home without
having four things in their trunks with them, namely:
(1) A box of matches, in order, at any moment of the
night, to strike a light, both to discover and frighten
the enemies away. (2) A box of night-lights. Bugs
never bite when there is a light in the room. It would
therefore be well, in an infested room, and until fresh
lodgings can be procured, to keep a night-light burning
all night. (3) A packet of “<i><span lang="fr">La Poudre Insecticide</span></i>,”
manufactured in France, but which may be procured
in England: a preparation which, although perfectly
harmless to the human economy, is utterly destructive
to fleas. (4) A 4 oz. bottle of oil of turpentine, a little of
which, in case of a discovery of bugs in the bed, should
be sprinkled between the sheets and on the pillow.
The oil of turpentine will, until fresh lodgings can be
procured, keep the bugs at a respectful distance. Care
should be observed while sprinkling the sheets with
the turpentine not to have (on account of its inflammability)
a lighted candle too near the bed. I know, from
experience, that bugs and fleas are, when ladies are
away from home, a source of torment and annoyance,
and am therefore fully persuaded of the value and importance
of the above advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>180. If it be not practicable for her to visit the sea-coast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>let her be in the fresh air—in the country air.
Let her mornings be spent out of doors; and if she
cannot inhale the <i>sea</i> breezes, let her inhale the <i>morning</i>
breezes—</p>

<p class='c008'>181. Cheerfulness and evenness of temper ought, by
a young wife, to be especially cultivated. There is
nothing that promotes digestion, and thus good health,
more than a cheerful, placid temper. We know that
the converse is very detrimental to that process; that
violent passion takes away the appetite, deranges the
stomach, and frequently disorders the bowels. Hence
it is that those who attain great ages are usually of an
even, cheerful temper. “Our passions are compared
to the winds in the air, which, when gentle and moderate,
let them fill the sail, and they will carry the ship
on smoothly to the desired port; but when violent, unmanageable,
and boisterous, it grows to a storm, and
threatens the ruin and destruction of all.”<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>182. A young wife is apt to take too much opening
medicine; the more she takes, the more she requires.
Hence she irritates the nerves of the stomach and
bowels, and injures herself beyond measure. If the
bowels are costive, and variety of food, and of fruit,
and of other articles of diet, which I either have or
will recommend in these pages, together with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>abundance of air, and of exercise, and of occupation,
will not open, then let her give herself an enema;
which she can, without the slightest pain or annoyance,
and with very little trouble, readily do, provided
she has a proper apparatus for the purpose, namely, a
“self-injecting enema apparatus,”—one made purposely
for the patient, either to administer it to herself, or to
be administered to her by another person. A pint of
<i>cold</i> water is as good an enema as can be used, and
which, if the first should not operate, ought in a few
minutes to be repeated. The clyster does nothing
more than wash the bowels out, removing any offending
matter, and any depression of spirits arising therefrom,
and neither interfering with the stomach nor with
the digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>183. Until she become accustomed to the cold, she
might for the first few mornings slightly warm the
water; but gradually she should reduce the temperature
of it until she use it quite cold. A <i>cold</i> water is
more bracing and strengthening to the bowels, and
more efficacious in action, than a <i>warm</i> water enema.</p>

<p class='c008'>184. It will, during pregnancy and after a confinement,
be safer to use a <i>tepid</i> than a <i>cold</i> water
enema.</p>

<p class='c008'>185. No family ought to be without a <i>good</i> enema
apparatus, to fly to in any emergency. Many valuable
lives have been saved by means of it, and having it
always in good order and at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>186. By adopting the dictates of reason and of common sense,
many of the nervous, useless, lackadaisical,
fine ladies will be unknown; and we shall have instead
blooming wives, who will in due time become the
mothers of hardy, healthy, happy children.</p>

<p class='c008'>187. In the foregoing pages the burden of my song
has been health—the preservation of health—the most
precious of God’s gifts, and one that is frittered and
fooled away as though it were but of little value.
Health ought to be the first consideration of all, and of
every young wife especially, as, when she is married,
her life, her health is not altogether her own, but her
husband’s and her family’s. Oh! it is a glorious gift,
a precious boon, to be in the enjoyment of perfect
health, and is worth a little care and striving for.</p>

<p class='c008'>188. In concluding the first division of my subject,
let me entreat my fair reader to ponder well on what I
have already said; let her remember that she has a
glorious mission; let her thoroughly understand that if
good habits and good rules be not formed and followed
during the first year of her wifehood, they are not at
all likely to be instituted afterwards. The first year,
then, is the golden opportunity to sow the seeds of usefulness;
to make herself healthy and strong, and to
cause her to be a blessing, a solace, and a comfort to
her husband, her children, and all around her.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>189. Menstruation, during a period of about thirty
years, plays a momentous part in the female economy;
indeed, unless it be <i>in every way</i> properly and duly
performed, it is neither possible that such a lady can
be well, nor is it at all probable that she will conceive.
I therefore purpose devoting an especial chapter to its
due and careful consideration.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span></div>
<div class='chapter'>

<h3 class='c001'>PART I.<br> <span class='c016'>MENSTRUATION.</span></h3>

</div>

<p class='c007'>190. There are two most important epochs in the
life of a woman—namely (1) the commencement, and
(2) the close of menstruation. Each is apt, unless
carefully watched and prevented, to bring in its train
many serious diseases. Moreover, unless menstruation
be healthfully and properly performed, conception,
as a rule, is not likely to take place: hence the importance
of our subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>191. Menstruation—the appearance of the catamenia
or the menses—is then <i>one of the most important epochs</i>
in a girl’s life. It is the boundary line, the landmark,
between childhood and womanhood; it is the threshold,
so to speak, of a <i>woman’s</i> life. Her body now develops
and expands, and her mental capacity enlarges and improves.
She then ceases to be a child, and she becomes
a woman. She is now for the first time, as a
rule, able to conceive.</p>

<p class='c008'>192. Although puberty has at this time commenced,
it cannot be said that she is at her full perfection; it
takes eight or ten years more to complete her organization,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>which will bring her to the age of twenty-three
or twenty-five years; which perhaps are the best ages
for a woman, if she have both the chance and the inclination,
to marry.</p>

<p class='c008'>193. If she marry when very young, marriage
weakens her system, and prevents a full development
of the body. Besides, if she marry when she be only
eighteen or nineteen, the bones of the pelvis—the bones
of the lower part of the belly—are not at that time sufficiently
developed; are not properly shaped for the
purpose of labor; do not allow of sufficient space for
the head of the child to <i>readily</i> pass, as though she
were of the riper age of twenty-three or twenty-five.
She might have in consequence a severe and dangerous
confinement. If she marry late in life, say after she
be thirty, the soft parts engaged in parturition are more
rigid and more tense, and thus become less capable of
dilatation, which might cause, for the <i>first</i> time, a hard
and tedious labor. Again, when she marries late in
life, she might not live to see her children grow up to
be men and women. Moreover, as a rule, “the offspring
of those that are very young or very old lasts
not.” Everything, therefore, points out that the age
above indicated—namely, somewhere between twenty
and thirty—is the most safe and suitable time for a
woman to marry.</p>

<p class='c008'>194. Menstruation generally comes on once every
month—that is to say, every twenty-eight days; usually
to the very day, and frequently to the hour. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>ladies, instead of being “regular” every month, are
“regular” every three weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>195. Each menstruation continues from three to five
days; in some for a week; and in others for a longer
period. It is estimated that, during each menstruation,
from four to six ounces is, on an average, the quantity
discharged.</p>

<p class='c008'>196. A lady seldom conceives unless she be “regular,”
although there are cases on record where women
have conceived who have never been “unwell;” but
such cases are extremely rare.</p>

<p class='c008'>197. Menstruation in this country usually commences
at the ages of from thirteen to sixteen, sometimes earlier;
occasionally as early as eleven or twelve;
at other times later, and not until a girl be seventeen
or eighteen years of age. Menstruation in large towns
is supposed to commence at an earlier period than in
the country, and earlier in luxurious than in simple
life.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>198. Menstruation continues for thirty, and sometimes
even for thirty-five years; and, while it lasts, is
a sign that a lady is liable to become pregnant—unless,
indeed, menstruation should be protracted much
beyond the usual period of time. As a rule, then,
when a woman “ceases to be unwell,” she ceases to
have a family; therefore, as menstruation usually
leaves her at forty-five, it is seldom, after that age, that
she has a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>199. I have known ladies become mothers when
they have been upwards of fifty years of age. I myself
delivered a woman in her fifty-first year of a fine
healthy child. She had a kind and easy labor, and
was the mother of a large family, the youngest being
at the time twelve years old.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> “Dr. Carpenter, of Durham,
tells us that he has attended in their confinements
several women whose ages were fifty. ‘I well recollect
a case occurring in my father’s practice in 1839,
where a woman became a widow at forty-nine years of
age. Shortly afterwards she married her second husband,
and within twelve months of this time gave birth
to her <i>first</i> child. These cases belong to the working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>classes. But I know of two others, where gentlewomen
became mothers at fifty-one with her first
child, the other with her eighth. I can say nothing of
how they menstruated, but I know of a virgin in whom
the catamenia appeared <i>regularly</i> and undiminished up
to and at the end of sixty.’ Dr. Powell says that he
last year attended a woman in her fifty-second year;
and Mr. Heckford, that he attended a woman who
stated her age to be at least fifty. Mr. Clarke, of Mold,
states that he has attended several women whose ages
were upwards of forty-four, and that he lately delivered
a woman of her first child at forty-eight. Mr. Bloxham,
of Portsmouth, delivered at fifty-two, in her first
confinement, a woman who had been married thirty-five
years.”<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>200. In very warm climates, such as in Abyssinia
and in India, girls menstruate when very young—at
ten or eleven years old; indeed, they are sometimes
mothers at those ages.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> But when it commences early,
it leaves early; so that they are old women at thirty.
“Physically, we know that there is a very large latitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of difference in the periods of human maturity,
not merely between individual and individual, but also
between nation and nation—differences so great that
in some southern regions of Asia we hear of matrons
at the age of twelve.”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Dr. Montgomery<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> brings
forward some interesting cases of early maturity. He
says: “Bruce mentions that in Abyssinia he has frequently
seen mothers of eleven years of age; and Dunlop
witnessed the same in Bengal. Dr. Goodeve, Professor
of Midwifery at Calcutta, in reply to a query on
the subject, said: ‘The earliest age at which I have
<i>known</i> a Hindu woman bear a child is ten years, but I
have <i>heard</i> of one at nine.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>201. In cold climates, such as Russia, women begin
to menstruate late in life, frequently not until they are
between twenty and thirty years old; and, as it lasts
on them thirty or thirty-five years, it is not an unusual
occurrence for them to bear children at a very advanced
age—even so late as sixty. They are frequently not
“regular” oftener than three or four times a year, and
when it does occur the menstrual discharge is generally
sparing in quantity.</p>

<p class='c008'>202. The menstrual fluid is not exactly blood,
although, both in appearance and in properties, it
much resembles it; yet it never in the healthy state
clots as blood does. It is a secretion from the womb,
and, when healthy, ought to be of a bright-red color,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>in appearance very much like blood from a recently
cut finger.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>203. The menstrual fluid ought not, as before observed,
to clot. If it does, a lady, during menstruation,
suffers intense pain; moreover, she seldom conceives
until the clotting has ceased. Application must therefore,
in such a case, be made to a medical man, who
will soon relieve the above painful symptoms, and, by
doing so, will probably pave the way to her becoming
pregnant.</p>

<p class='c008'>204. Menstruation ceases <i>entirely</i> in pregnancy, during
suckling, and usually both in diseased and in disordered
states of the womb. It also ceases in cases of
extreme debility, and in severe illness, especially in consumption;
indeed, in the latter disease—consumption—it
is one of the most unfavorable of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>205. It has been asserted, and by men of great experience,
that sometimes a woman <i>menstruates</i> during
pregnancy. In this assertion I cannot agree; it appears
utterly impossible that she should be able to do so.
The moment she conceives, the neck of the womb becomes
plugged up by means of mucus; it is, in fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>hermetically sealed. There certainly is sometimes a
slight red discharge, looking very much like menstrual
fluid, and coming on at her monthly periods; but
being usually very sparing in quantity, and lasting only
a day or so, and sometimes only for an hour or two;
but this discharge does not come from the cavity of, but
from some small vessels at, the mouth of the womb,
and is not menstrual fluid at all, but a few drops of real
blood. If this discharge came from the cavity of the
womb, it would probably lead to a miscarriage. My
old respected and talented teacher, the late Dr. D.
D. Davis,<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> declared that it would be quite impossible
during pregnancy for menstruation to occur. He considered
that the discharge which was taken for menstruation
arose from the rupture of some small vessels
about the mouth of the womb.</p>

<p class='c008'>206. Some ladies, though comparatively few, menstruate
during suckling; when they do, it may be considered
not the rule, but the exception. It is said, in
such instances, that they are more likely to conceive.
Many persons have an idea that when a woman, during
lactation, menstruates, the milk is both sweeter and
purer. Such is an error. Menstruation during suckling
is more likely to weaken the mother, and consequently
to deteriorate the milk. It therefore behooves a parent
never to take a wet nurse who menstruates during the
period of suckling.</p>

<p class='c008'>207. A lady sometimes suffers severe pains both just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>before and during her “poorly” times. When such be
the case, she seldom conceives until the pain be removed.
She ought therefore to apply to a medical man, as relief
may soon be obtained. When she is freed from the
pain, she will, in all probability, in due time become
<i>enceinte</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>208. If a married woman have painful menstruation,
even if she become pregnant, she is more likely, in the
early stage, to miscarry. This is an important consideration,
and requires the attention of a doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>209. If a single lady, who is about to be married,
have painful menstruation, it is incumbent on either
her mother or a female friend to consult, two or three
months before the marriage takes place, an experienced
medical man, on her case; if this be not done, she will
most likely, after marriage, either labor under ill health,
or be afflicted with barrenness, or, if she do conceive,
be prone to miscarry.</p>

<p class='c008'>210. The menstrual discharge, as before remarked,
ought, if healthy, to be of the color of blood—of fresh,
unclotted blood. If it be either too pale (and it sometimes
is almost colorless), or, on the other hand, if it be
both dark and thick (it is occasionally as dark, and
sometimes nearly as thick, as treacle), there will be
but scant hopes of a lady conceiving. A medical man
ought, therefore, at once to be consulted, who will in
the generality of cases, be able to remedy the defect.
The chances are, that as soon as the defect be remedied,
she will become pregnant.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>211. Menstruation at another time is too sparing;
this is a frequent cause of a want of family. Luckily
a doctor is, in the majority of cases, able to remedy the
defect, and by doing so will probably be the means of
bringing the womb into a healthy state, and thus predispose
her to become a mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>212. A married lady is very subject to the “whites;”
the more there will be of the “whites” the less there
will usually be of the menstrual discharge;—so that in
a bad case of the “whites” menstruation might entirely
cease, until proper means be used both to restrain the
one and to bring back the other. Indeed, as a rule,
if the menstrual discharge, by proper treatment, be
healthily established and restored, the “whites” will
often cease of themselves. Deficient menstruation is a
frequent cause of the “whites,” and the consequent
failure of a family; and as deficient menstruation is
usually curable, a medical man ought, in all such cases,
to be consulted.</p>

<p class='c008'>213. Menstruation at other times is either too profuse
or too long continued. Either the one or the
other is a frequent source of barrenness, and is also
weakening to the constitution, and thus tends to bring
a lady into a bad state of health. This, like the former
cases, by judicious management may generally be
rectified; and being rectified, will in all probability
result in the wife becoming a mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>214. When a lady is neither pregnant nor “regular,”
she ought immediately to apply to a doctor, as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>may depend upon it there is something wrong about
her, and that she is not likely to become <i>enceinte</i><a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> until
menstruation be properly established. As soon as menstruation
be duly and healthily established, pregnancy
will most likely, in due time, ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>215. When a lady is said to be “regular,” it is
understood that she is “regular” as to <i>quality</i>, and
<i>quantity</i>, and <i>time</i>. If she be only “regular” as to the
<i>time</i>, and the <i>quantity</i> be either deficient or in excess,
or if she be “regular” as to the <i>time</i>, and the <i>quality</i>
be bad, either too pale or too dark; or if she be
“regular” as to the <i>quality</i> and <i>quantity</i>, and be
irregular as to the <i>time</i>, she cannot be well; and the
sooner means are adopted to rectify the evil, the better
it will be for her health and happiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>216. There is among young wives, of the higher
ranks, of the present time, an immense deal of hysteria;
indeed it is, among them, in one form or another, the
most frequent complaint of the day. Can it be wondered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>at? Certainly not. The fashionable system of
spending married life, such as late hours, close rooms,
excitement, rounds of visiting, luxurious living, is quite
enough to account for its prevalence. The menstrual
functions in a case of this kind are not duly performed;
she is either too much or too little “unwell;” menstruation
occurs either too soon, or too late, or at
irregular periods. I need scarcely say that such a
one, until a different order of things be instituted, and
until proper and efficient means be used to restore
healthy menstruation, is not likely to conceive; or, if
she did conceive, she would most likely either miscarry,
or, if she did go her time, bring forth a puny,
delicate child. A fashionable wife and happy mother
are incompatibilities! Oh, it is sad to contemplate
the numerous victims that are sacrificed yearly on the
shrine of fashion! The grievous part of the business
is, that fashion is not usually amenable to reason and
common sense; argument, entreaty, ridicule, are each
and all alike in turn powerless in the matter. Be that
as it might, I am determined boldly to proclaim the
truth, and to make plain the awful danger of a wife
becoming a votary of fashion.</p>

<p class='c008'>217. Many a lady, either from suppressed or from
deficient menstruation, who is now chlorotic, hysterical,
and dyspeptic, weak and nervous, looking wretchedly,
and whose very life is a burden, may, by applying to a
medical man, be restored to health and strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>218. As soon as a lady “ceases to be after the manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of women”—that is to say, as soon as she <i>ceases
to menstruate</i>—it is said that she has “a change of
life;” and if she does not take care, she will soon have
“a change of health” to boot, which, in all probability,
will be for the worse.</p>

<p class='c008'>219. After a period of about thirty years’ continuation
of menstruation, a woman <i>ceases to menstruate</i>;
that is to say, when she is about forty-four or forty-five
years of age, and, occasionally, as late in life as when
she is forty-eight years of age, she has “change of
life,” or, as it is sometimes called, a “turn of years.”
Now, before this takes place, she oftentimes becomes
very “irregular;” at one time she is “regular” before
her proper period; at another time either before or
after; so that it becomes a <i>dodging time</i> with her, as
it is so styled. In a case of this kind menstruation is
sometimes very profuse; at another it is very sparing;
occasionally it is light colored, almost colorless; sometimes
it is as red as from a cut finger; while now and
then it is as black as ink.</p>

<p class='c008'>220. When “change of life” is about, and during the
time, and for some time afterwards, a lady labors under,
at times, great flushings of heat; she, as it were, blushes
all over; she goes very hot and red, almost scarlet;
then perspires; and afterwards becomes cold and
chilly. These flushings occur at very irregular periods;
they might come on once or twice a day, at other times
only once or twice a week, and occasionally only at
what would have been her “poorly times.” These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>flushings might be looked upon as rather favorable
symptoms, and as an effort of nature to relieve itself
through the skin. These flushings are occasionally,
although rarely, attended with hysterical symptoms.
A little appropriate medicine is for these flushings desirable.
A lady while laboring under these heats is
generally both very much annoyed and distressed; but
she ought to comfort herself with the knowledge that
they are in all probability doing her good service, and
that they might be warding off, from some internal
organ of her body, serious mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>221. “Change of life” is one of the most important
periods of a lady’s existence, and generally determines
whether, for the rest of her days, she shall either be
healthy or otherwise; it therefore imperatively behooves
her to pay attention to the subject, and in all
cases when it is about taking place to consult a medical
man, who will, in the majority of cases, be of great
benefit to her, as he will be able to ward off many important
and serious diseases to which she would otherwise
be liable. When “change of life” ends favorably,
which, if properly managed, it most likely will do, she
may improve in constitution, and may really enjoy better
health and spirits, and more comfort, then she has
done for many previous years. A lady who has during
the whole of her wifehood eschewed fashionable society,
and who has lived simply, plainly, and sensibly, and
who has taken plenty of out-door exercise, will, during
the autumn and winter of life, reap her reward by enjoying
what is the greatest earthly blessing—health!</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<h3 class='c001'>PART II.<br> <span class='c016'>PREGNANCY.</span></h3>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'>SIGNS OF PREGNANCY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>222. The first sign that leads a lady to suspect that
she is pregnant is her <i>ceasing to be unwell</i>. This,
provided she has just before been in good health, is a
strong symptom of pregnancy; but still there must be
others to corroborate it.</p>

<p class='c008'>223. The next symptom is <i>morning sickness</i>. This
is one of the earliest symptoms of pregnancy; as it
sometimes occurs a few days, and indeed generally not
later than a fortnight or three weeks, after conception.
Morning sickness is frequently distressing, oftentimes
amounting to vomiting, and causing a loathing of breakfast.
This sign usually disappears after the first three
or four months. Morning sickness is not always present
in pregnancy; but, nevertheless, it is a frequent
accompaniment; and many who have had families
place more reliance on this than on any other symptom.</p>

<p class='c008'>224. A third symptom is <i>shooting, throbbing, and
lancinating pains, and enlargement of the breasts</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span><i>with soreness of the nipples</i>, occurring about the
second month; and in some instances, after the first
few months, a small quantity of watery fluid, or a
little milk, may be squeezed out of them. This latter
symptom, in a <i>first</i> pregnancy, is valuable, and can
generally be relied on as conclusive that the female is
pregnant. It is not so valuable in an <i>after</i> pregnancy,
as a <i>little</i> milk might, even should she not be pregnant,
remain in the breasts for some months after she has
weaned her child.</p>

<p class='c008'>225. The veins of the breast look more blue, and are
consequently more conspicuous than usual, giving the
bosom a mottled appearance. The breasts themselves
are firmer and more knotty to the touch. The nipples,
in the majority of cases, look more <i>healthy</i> than customary,
and are somewhat elevated and enlarged;
there is generally a slight moisture upon their surface,
sufficient in some instances to mark the linen.</p>

<p class='c008'>226. A dark-brown areola or disk may usually be
noticed around the nipple,<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a> the change of color commencing
about the second month. The tint at first is
light brown, which gradually deepens in intensity, until,
toward the end of pregnancy, the color may be very
dark. Dr. Montgomery, who has paid great attention
to the subject, observes: “During the progress of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>next two or three months the changes in the areola are
in general perfected, or nearly so, and then it presents
the following characters: a circle around the nipple,
whose color varies in intensity according to the particular
complexion of the individual, being usually
much darker in persons with black hair, dark eyes,
and sallow skin, than in those of fair hair, light-colored
eyes, and delicate complexion. The area of this circle
varies in diameter from an inch to an inch and a half,
and increases in most persons as pregnancy advances,
as does also the depth of color.” The dark areola is
somewhat swollen. “There is,” says Dr. Montgomery,
“a puffy turgescence, not only of the nipple, but of the
whole surrounding disk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>227. A fourth symptom is <i>quickening</i>. This generally
occurs about the completion of the <i>fourth</i> calendar
month; frequently a week or two before the end
of that period; at other times a week or two later. A
lady sometimes quickens as early as the <i>third</i> month,
while others, although rarely, quicken as late as the
<i>fifth</i>, and, <i>in very rare cases</i>, the <i>sixth</i> month.</p>

<p class='c008'>228. It will therefore be seen that there is an uncertainty
as to the period of quickening, although, as I
before remarked, the <i>usual</i> period occurs either on, or
more frequently a week or two before, the completion
of the <i>fourth</i> calendar month of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>229. A lady at this time frequently either feels faint,
or actually faints away; she is often either giddy, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>sick, or nervous, and in some instances even hysterical.
Although, in rare cases, some women do not even
know the precise time when they quicken.</p>

<p class='c008'>230. The sensation of “quickening” is said by many
ladies to resemble the fluttering of a bird. “Quickening”
arises from the ascent of the womb higher into
the belly, as, from its increased size, there is not room
for it below. The old-fashioned idea was that the child
was not alive until a woman had quickened. This is a
mistaken notion, as he is alive, or “quick,” from the
very commencement of his formation.</p>

<p class='c008'>231. Hence the heinous and damnable sin of a single
woman, in the <i>early</i> months of pregnancy, using
means to promote abortion: it is as much murder as
though the child were at his full time, or as though he
were butchered when he was actually born!</p>

<p class='c008'>232. An attempt, then, to procure abortion is a crime
of the deepest dye, viz., a heinous murder! It is attended,
moreover, with fearful consequences to the
mother’s own health; it may either cause her <i>immediate</i>
death, or it may so grievously injure her constitution
that she might never recover from the shock. If
these fearful consequences ensue, she ought not to be
pitied: she richly deserves them all. Our profession
is a noble one, and every qualified member of it would
scorn and detest the very idea either of promoting or
of procuring an abortion; but there are unqualified
villains who practice the damnable art. Transportation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>if not hanging, ought to be their doom. The
seducers, who often assist and abet them in their
nefarious practices, should share their punishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>233. Flatulence has sometimes misled a young wife
to fancy that she has quickened; but, in determining
whether she be pregnant, she ought never to be satisfied
with one symptom alone; if she be, she will be frequently
misled. The following are a few of the symptoms
that will distinguish the one from the other: in
flatulence, the patient is small one hour and large the
next; while in pregnancy the enlargement is persistent,
and daily and gradually increases. In flatulence,
on pressing the bowels firmly, a rumbling of wind may
be heard, which will move about at will; while the
enlargement of the womb in pregnancy is solid, resistant,
and stationary. In flatulence, on tapping—percussing—the
belly there will be a hollow sound elicited
as from a drum; while in pregnancy it will be a dull,
heavy sound, as from thrumming on a table. In flatulence,
if the points of the fingers be firmly pressed into
the belly, the wind will wobble about; in pregnancy
they will be resisted as by a wall of flesh.</p>

<p class='c008'>234. The fifth symptom is, immediately after the
quickening, <i>increased size and hardness of the belly</i>.
An accumulation of fat covering the belly has sometimes
led a lady to suspect that she is pregnant; but
the soft and doughy feeling of the fat is very different
to the hardness, solidity, and resistance of pressure of
pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>235. The sixth symptom is <i>pouting or protrusion of
the navel</i>. This symptom does not occur until some
time after a lady has quickened; indeed, for the first
two months of pregnancy the navel is drawn in and
depressed. As the pregnancy advances, the navel
gradually comes more forward. “The navel, according
to the progress of the pregnancy, is constantly
emerging, till it comes to an even surface with the integuments
of the abdomen [belly]; and to this circumstance
much regard is to be paid in cases of doubtful
pregnancy.”<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>236. <i>Sleepiness</i>, <i>heartburn</i>, <i>increased flow of saliva</i>,
<i>toothache</i>, <i>loss of appetite</i>, <i>longings</i>, <i>excitability of
mind</i>, <i>a pinched appearance of countenance</i>, <i>liver or
sulphur-colored patches on the skin</i>, and <i>likes</i> and <i>dislikes</i>
in eating,—either the one or the other of these
symptoms frequently accompany pregnancy; but, as
they might arise from other causes, they are not to be
relied on further than this—that if they attend the
more certain signs of pregnancy, such as cessation of
being “regular,” morning sickness, pains and enlargement
of and milk in the breasts, the gradually darkening
brown areola or mark around the nipple, etc., they
will then make assurance doubly sure, and a lady may
know for certain that she is pregnant.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>CLOTHING.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>237. A lady who is pregnant ought on no account to
wear tight dresses, as the child should have plenty of
room. She ought to be, as <i>enceinte</i> signifies, <i>incincta</i>,
or unbound. Let the clothes be adapted to the gradual
development both of the belly and the breasts.
She must, whatever she may usually do, wear her stays
loose. If there be bones in the stays, let them be removed.
Tight lacing is injurious both to the mother
and to the child, and frequently causes the former to
miscarry; at another time it has produced a crossbirth;
and sometimes it has so pressed in the nipples
as to prevent a proper development of them, so that
where a lady has gone her time, she has been unable
to suckle her infant, the attempt often causing a gathered
bosom. These are great misfortunes, and entail
great misery both on the mother and the child (if it has
not already killed him), and ought to be a caution and
a warning to every lady for the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>238. The feet and legs during pregnancy are very
apt to swell and to be painful, and the veins of the
legs to be largely distended. The garters ought at such
times to be worn slack, as tight garters are highly injurious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and, if the veins be very much distended, it
will be necessary for her to wear a properly-adjusted
elastic silk stocking, made purposely to fit her foot and
leg, and which a medical man will himself procure for
her.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>ABLUTION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>239. A <i>warm</i> bath in pregnancy is too relaxing. A
<i>tepid</i> bath once a week is beneficial. Sponging the
whole of the body every morning with lukewarm
water may with safety and advantage be adopted,
gradually reducing the temperature of the water until
it be used quite cold. The skin should, with moderately
coarse towels, be quickly but thoroughly dried.</p>

<p class='c008'>240. Either the <i>bidet</i> or sitz-bath<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> ought <i>every morning</i>
to be used. The patient should first sponge herself,
and then finish up by sitting for a few seconds, or
while, in the winter, she can count fifty, or while, in the
summer, she can count a hundred, in the water. It is
better not to be long in it; it is a slight shock that is
required, which, where the sitz-bath agrees, is immediately
followed by an agreeable glow of the whole body.
If she sits in the water for a long time she becomes
chilled and tired, and is very likely to catch cold. She
ought, until she become accustomed to the cold, to have
a dash of warm water added; but the sooner she can
use <i>quite cold</i> water the better. While sitting in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>bath she should throw either a woolen shawl or a
small blanket over her shoulders. <i>She will find the
greatest comfort and benefit from adopting the above
recommendation.</i> Instead of giving, it will prevent
cold, and it will be one of the means of warding off a
miscarriage, and of keeping her in good health.</p>

<p class='c008'>241. A shower-bath in pregnancy gives too great a
shock, and might induce a miscarriage. I should <i>not</i>
recommend, for a lady who is pregnant, sea-bathing;
nevertheless, if she be delicate, and if she be prone to
miscarry, change of air to the coast (provided it be not
too far away from home), and inhaling the sea breezes,
may brace her, and ward off the tendency. But although
sea-bathing be not desirable, sponging the body
with sea water may be of great service to her.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>AIR AND EXERCISE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>242. A young wife, in her <i>first</i> pregnancy, usually
takes <i>too long</i> walks. This is a common cause of
<i>flooding</i>, of <i>miscarriage</i>, and of <i>bearing down</i> of the
<i>womb</i>. As soon, therefore, as a lady has the <i>slightest
suspicion</i> that she is <i>enceinte</i>, she must be careful in
the taking of exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>243. Although <i>long</i> walks are injurious, she ought
not to run into an opposite extreme; short, gentle, and
frequent walks during the whole period of pregnancy
cannot be too strongly recommended; indeed, a lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>who is <i>enceinte</i> ought to live half her time in the open
air. Fresh air and exercise prevent many of the unpleasant
symptoms attendant on that state; they keep
her in health; they tend to open her bowels; and they
relieve that sensation of faintness and depression so
common and distressing in <i>early</i> pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>244. Exercise, fresh air, and occupation are then essentially
necessary in pregnancy. If they be neglected,
hard and tedious labors are likely to ensue. One, and
an important, reason of the easy and quick labors and
rapid “gettings about” of poor women, is the abundance
of exercise and of occupation which they are both
daily and hourly obliged to get through. Why, many
a poor woman thinks but little of a confinement,
while a rich one is full of anxiety about the result.
Let the rich lady adopt the poor woman’s industrious
and abstemious habits, and labor need not
then be looked forward to, as it frequently now is,
either with dread or with apprehension.</p>

<p class='c008'>245. Stooping, lifting of heavy weights, and overreaching
ought to be carefully avoided. Running,
horse exercise, and dancing are likewise dangerous—they
frequently induce a miscarriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>246. Indolence is most injurious in pregnancy. A
lady who, during the greater part of the day, lolls
either on the sofa or on an easy-chair, and who seldom
walks out, has a much more lingering and painful labor
than one who takes moderate and regular open-air
exercise, and who attends to her household duties.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>247. An active life is, then, the principal reason
why the wives of the poor have such quick and easy
labors, and such good recoveries; why their babies
are so rosy, healthy, and strong; notwithstanding the
privations and hardships and poverty of the parents.</p>

<p class='c008'>248. Bear in mind, then, that a lively, active woman
has an easier and quicker labor, and a finer race of
children, than one who is lethargic and indolent. Idleness
brings misery, anguish, and suffering in its
train, and particularly affects pregnant ladies. Oh, that
these words would have due weight, then this book
will not have been written in vain. The hardest work
in the world is having nothing to do! “Idle people
have the most labor;” this is particularly true in pregnancy;
a lady will, when labor actually sets in, find to
her cost that idleness has given her most labor. “Idleness
is the badge of gentry, the bane of body and mind,
the nurse of Naughtiness, the step-mother of Discipline,
the chief author of all Mischief, one of the
seven deadly sins, the cushion upon which the Devil
chiefly reposes, and a great cause not only of Melancholy,
but of many other diseases, for the mind is
naturally active; and, if it be not occupied about
some honest business, it rushes into Mischief or sinks
into Melancholy.”<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>249. A lady sometimes looks upon pregnancy more
as a disease than as a natural process; hence she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>treats herself as though she was a regular invalid,
and, unfortunately, she too often makes herself really
one by improper and by foolish indulgences.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>VENTILATION—DRAINAGE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>250. Let a lady look well to the <i>ventilation</i> of her
house; let her take care that every chimney be unstopped,
and during the daytime that every window in
every unoccupied room be thrown open.</p>

<p class='c008'>251. Where there is a skylight at the top of the
house, it is well to have it made to open and to shut,
so that in the daytime it may, winter and summer, be
always open; and in the summer time it may, day and
night, be left unclosed. Nothing so thoroughly ventilates
and purifies a house as an open skylight.</p>

<p class='c008'>252. If a lady did but know the importance—the
vital importance—of ventilation, she would see that
the above directions were carried out to the very letter.
My firm belief is that if more attention were paid to
ventilation—to thorough ventilation—child-bed fever
would be an almost unknown disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>253. The cooping-up system is abominable; it engenders
all manner of infectious and of loathsome
diseases, and not only engenders them, but feeds them,
and thus keeps them alive. There is nothing wonderful
in all this, if we consider but for one moment that
the exhalations from the lungs are poisonous! That is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to say, that the lungs give off carbonic acid gas (a
deadly poison), which, if it be not allowed to escape
out of the room, must over and over again be breathed.
That if the perspiration of the body (which in twenty-four
hours amounts to two or three pounds) be not
permitted to escape out of the apartment, must become
fetid—repugnant to the nose, sickening to the stomach,
and injurious to the health. Oh, how often the nose
is a sentinel, and warns its owner of approaching
danger!</p>

<p class='c008'>254. Truly the nose is a sentinel! The Almighty
has sent bad smells for our benefit to warn us of danger.
If it were not for an unpleasant smell, we should
be constantly running into destruction. How often we
hear of an ignorant person using disinfectants and fumigations
to deprive drains and other horrid places of
their odors, as though, if the place could be robbed of
its smell, it could be robbed of its danger! Strange
infatuation! No; the frequent flushings of drains, the
removal of nuisances, cleanliness, a good scrubbing of
soap and water, sunshine, and the air and winds of
heaven, are the best disinfectants in the world. A celebrated
and eccentric lecturer on surgery,<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> in addressing
his class, made the following quaint and sensible
remark: “Fumigations, gentlemen, are of essential
importance; they make so abominable a stink that
they compel you to open the windows and admit fresh
air.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>255. It is doubtless, then, admirably appointed that,
we are able to detect “the well-defined and several
stinks;” for the danger is not in them,—to destroy the
smell is not to destroy the danger; certainly not! The
right way to do away with the danger is to remove the
cause, and the effect will cease; flushing a sewer is far
more efficacious than disinfecting one; soap and water
and the scrubbing-brush, and sunshine and thorough
ventilation, each and all are far more beneficial than
either permanganate of potash, or chloride of zinc, or
chloride of lime. People nowadays think too much
of disinfectants and too little of removal of causes; they
think too much of artificial, and too little of natural
means. It is a sad mistake to lean so much on, and to
trust so much to, man’s inventions!</p>

<p class='c008'>256. What is wanted, nowadays, is a little less
theory and a great deal more common sense. A rat,
for instance, is, in theory, grossly maligned; he is considered
to be very destructive, an enemy to man, and
one that ought to be destroyed—every man’s hand
being against him. Now, a rat is, by common sense,
well known to be, in its proper place—that is to say, in
sewers and in drains—destructive only to man’s enemies—to
the organic matter that breeds fevers, cholera,
diphtheria, etc.; the rat eats the pabulum or food which
would otherwise convert towns into hot-beds of terrible
diseases. That which is a rat’s food is often a man’s
poison; hence a rat is one of the best friends that a man
has, and ought, in his proper place, to be in every way
protected; the rat, in drains, is the very best of scavengers;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>in a sewer he is invaluable; in a house he is most
injurious; a rat in a sewer is worth gallons of disinfectants,
and will, in purifying a sewer, beat all man’s
inventions hollow; the maligned rat, therefore, turns
out, if weighed by common sense, to be not only one
of the most useful of animals, but of public benefactors!
The rat’s element, then, is the sewer; he is the king of
the sewer, and should there reign supreme, and ought
not to be poisoned by horrid disinfectants.</p>

<p class='c008'>257. If a lady, while on an errand of mercy, should
in the morning go into a poor person’s bedroom after
he, she, or they (for oftentimes the room is crowded to
suffocation) have during the night been sleeping, and
where a breath of air is not allowed to enter—the
chimney and every crevice having been stopped up—and
where too much attention has not been paid to
personal cleanliness, she will experience a faintness,
an oppression, a sickness, a headache, a terribly fetid
smell; indeed, <i>she is in a poisoned chamber</i>! It is an
odor <i>sui generis</i>, which must be smelt to be remembered,
and will then never be forgotten! Pity the poor
who live in such styes—not fit for pigs! For pigs,
styes are ventilated. But take warning, ye well-to-do
in the world, and look well to your ventilation, or beware
of the consequences. “If,” says an able writer
on fever in the last century, “any person will take the
trouble to stand in the sun and look at his own shadow
on a white plastered wall, he will easily perceive that
his whole body is a smoking dunghill, with a vapor
exhaling from every part of it. This vapor is subtle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>acrid, and offensive to the smell; if retained in the
body it becomes morbid, but if reabsorbed, highly
deleterious. If a number of persons, therefore, are
long confined in any close place not properly ventilated,
so as to inspire and swallow with their spittle the
vapors of each other, they must soon feel its bad
effects.”<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>258. Not only should a lady look well to the ventilation
of her house, but either she or her husband ought
to ascertain that the <i>drains</i> are in good and perfect
order, and that the privies are frequently emptied of
their contents. Bad drainage and overflowing privies
are fruitful sources of child-bed fever, of gastric fever,
of scarlatina, of diphtheria, of cholera, and of a host
of other infections and contagious and dangerous diseases.
It is an abominable practice to allow dirt to
fester near human habitations; more especially as dirt,
when mixed with earth, is really so valuable in fertilizing
the soil. Lord Palmerston wisely says that
“dirt is only matter in the wrong place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>259. A lady ought to look well to the purity of her
<i>pump-water</i>, and to ascertain that no drain either enters
or percolates, or contaminates in any way whatever,
the spring; if it should do so, disease, such as either
cholera, or diarrhœa, or dysentery, or diphtheria, or
scarlet fever, or gastric fever, will, one or the other, as
a matter of course, ensue. If there be the slightest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>danger or risk of drain contamination, whenever it be
practicable, let the drain be taken up and be examined,
and let the defect be carefully rectified. When it be
impracticable to have the drain taken up and examined,
then let the pump-water, before drinking it, be <i>always</i>
previously boiled. The boiling of the water, as experience
teaches, has the power either of destroying or of
making innocuous the specific organic fecal life poison,
which propagates in drain contamination the diseases
above enumerated.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>NECESSITY OF OCCASIONAL REST.</h4>

<p class='c018'>260. A lady who is pregnant ought, for half an hour
each time, to lie one or two hours every day on the
sofa. This, if there be either a bearing down of the
womb, or if there be a predisposition to a miscarriage,
will be particularly necessary. I should recommend
this plan to be adopted throughout the whole period of
the pregnancy: in the early months, to prevent a miscarriage,
and, in the latter months, on account of the
increased weight and size of the womb.</p>

<p class='c008'>261. There is, occasionally, during the latter months,
a difficulty in lying down; the patient feeling as though,
every time she makes the attempt, she should be suffocated.
When such be the case, she ought to rest herself
upon the sofa, and be propped up with cushions,
as I consider rest at different periods of the day necessary
and beneficial. If there be any difficulty in lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>down at night, a bed-rest, well covered with pillows,
will be found a great comfort.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DIETARY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>262. An abstemious diet, during the <i>early</i> period of
pregnancy, is essential, as the habit of body, at that
time, is usually feverish and inflammatory. I should
therefore recommend abstinence from beer, porter, and
spirits. Let me, in this place, urge a lady, during her
pregnancy, not to touch spirits, such as either brandy
or gin; they will only inflame her blood, and will poison
and make puny her unborn babe; they will only
give her false spirits, and will depress her in an increased
ratio as soon as the effects of the brandy or of
the gin have passed away. She ought to eat meat
only but once a day. Rich soups and highly-seasoned
stews and dishes are injurious.</p>

<p class='c008'>263. A lady who is <i>enceinte</i> may depend upon it
that the less stimulants she takes at these times the
better it will be both for herself and for her infant; the
more kind will be her labor and her “getting about,”
and the more vigorous and healthy will be her child.</p>

<p class='c008'>264. It is a mistaken notion that she requires more
nourishment during early pregnancy than at any other
time; she, if anything, requires less. It has often
been asserted that a lady who is pregnant ought to eat
very heartily, as she has two to provide for. When it
is taken into account that during pregnancy she “ceases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to be unwell,” and therefore that there is no drain on
that score; and when it is also considered how small
the ovum containing the embryo is, not being larger
for the first two or three months than a hen’s egg, it
will be seen how futile is the assertion. A wife, therefore,
in early pregnancy, does not require more than at
another time; if anything, she requires less. Again:
during pregnancy, especially in the early stages, she is
more or less sick, feverish, and irritable, and a superabundance
of food would only add fuel to the fire, and
would increase her sickness, fever, and irritability.
Moreover, she frequently suffers from heartburn and
from indigestion. Can anything be more absurd, when
such is the case, than to overload a stomach already
loaded with food which it is not able to digest? No, let
nature in this, as in everything else, be her guide, and
she will not then go far wrong! When she is further
advanced in her pregnancy,—that is to say, when she
has quickened,—her appetite generally improves, and
she is much better in health than she was before; indeed,
after she has quickened, she is frequently in better
health than she ever has been. The appetite is now
increased. Nature points out that she requires more
nourishment than she did at first; for this reason, the
fœtus is now rapidly growing in size, and consequently
requires more support from the mother. Let the food,
therefore, of a pregnant woman be now increased in
quantity, but let it be both light and nourishing. Occasionally,
at this time, she has taken a dislike to meat;
if she has, she ought not to be forced to eat it, but
should have instead, poultry, game, fish, chicken-broth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>beef-tea, new milk, farinaceous food, such as rice, sago,
batter puddings, and, above all, if she has a craving
for it, good sound, ripe fruit.</p>

<p class='c008'>265. Roasted apples, ripe pears, raspberries, strawberries,
grapes, tamarinds, figs, Muscatel raisins, stewed
rhubarb, stewed pears, stewed prunes, the inside of
ripe gooseberries, and the juice of oranges, are, during
pregnancy, particularly beneficial; they both quench
the thirst and tend to open the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>266. The food of a pregnant woman cannot be too
plain; high-seasoned dishes ought, therefore, to be
avoided. Although the food be plain, it must be frequently
varied. She should ring the changes upon
butcher’s meat, poultry, game, and fish. It is a mistaken
notion, that people ought to eat the same food
over and over again, one day as another. The stomach
requires variety, or disease, as a matter of course, will
ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>267. Light puddings, such as either rice, or batter,
or suet-pudding, or fruit puddings, provided the paste
be plain, may be taken with advantage. Rich pastry
is highly objectionable.</p>

<p class='c008'>268. If she be plethoric, abstinence is still more
necessary, or she might have a tedious labor, or might
suffer severely. The old-fashioned treatment was to
bleed a pregnant patient if she were of a full habit of
body. A more absurd plan could not be adopted!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Bleeding would, by causing more blood to be made,
only increase the mischief; but certainly it would be
blood of an inferior quality, watery and poor. The
best way to diminish the quantity of blood is to moderate
the amount of food, to lessen the supplies.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SLEEP.</h4>

<p class='c018'>269. The bedroom of a pregnant lady ought, if practicable,
to be large and airy. Particular attention
must be paid to the <i>ventilation</i>. The chimney should
on no account be stopped. The door and the windows
ought in the daytime to be thrown wide open, and the
bedclothes should be thrown back, that the air might,
before the approach of night, well ventilate them.</p>

<p class='c008'>270. It is a mistaken practice for a pregnant woman,
or for any one else, to sleep with closely-drawn curtains.
Pure air and a frequent change of air are quite
as necessary—if not more so—during the night as during
the day: and how can it be pure, and how can it
be changed, if curtains are closely drawn around the
bed? Impossible. The roof of the bedstead ought
not to be covered with bed furniture; it should be open
to the ceiling, in order to prevent any obstruction to a
free circulation of air.</p>

<p class='c008'>271. The bed must not be loaded with clothes, more
especially with a thick coverlet. If the weather be
cold, let an <i>extra</i> blanket be put on the bed, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>perspiration can permeate through a blanket when it
cannot through a thick coverlet.</p>

<p class='c008'>272. A lady who is pregnant is sometimes restless
at night—she feels oppressed and hot. The best remedies
are:—(1) Scant clothing on the bed. (2) The
lower sash of the window, during the summer months,
to be left open to the extent of six or eight inches, and
during the winter months, to the extent of two or
three inches; provided the room be large, the bed be
neither near nor under the window, and the weather
be not intensely cold. If any or all of these latter
circumstances occur, then (3) the window to be closed
and the door to be left ajar (the landing or the skylight
window at the top of the house being left open all
night, and the door being secured from intrusion by
means of a door-chain.) (4) Attention to be paid, if
the bowels be costive—but not otherwise—to a <i>gentle</i>
action of the bowels by castor oil. (5) An abstemious
diet, avoiding stimulants of all kinds. (6) Gentle
walking exercise. (7) Sponging the body every morning—in
the winter with <i>tepid</i> water, and in the summer
with <i>cold</i> water. (8) Cooling fruits in the summer
are in such a case very grateful and refreshing.
(See paragraph 264.)</p>

<p class='c008'>273. A pregnant woman sometimes experiences an
inability to lie down, the attempt occasionally producing
a feeling of suffocation and of faintness. She
ought, under such circumstances, to lie on a bed-rest,
which must, by means of pillows, be made comfortable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and she should take, every night at bedtime, a
teaspoonful of sal-volatile in a wineglassful of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>274. Pains at night, during the latter end of the
time, are usually frequent, so as to make an inexperienced
lady fancy that her labor was commencing.
Little need be done; for unless the pains be violent,
nature ought not to be interfered with. If they be
violent, application should be made to a medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>275. A pregnant lady must retire early to rest. She
ought to be in bed every night by ten o’clock, and
should make a point of being up in good time in the
morning, that she may have a thorough ablution, a
stroll in the garden, and an early breakfast; and that
she may afterwards take a short walk either in the
country or in the grounds while the air is pure and
invigorating. But how often, more especially when a
lady is first married, is an opposite plan adopted! The
importance of bringing a healthy child into the world,
if not for her own and her husband’s sake, should induce
a wife to attend to the above remarks.</p>

<p class='c008'>276. Although some ladies, during pregnancy, are
very restless, others are very sleepy, so that they can
scarcely, even in the day, keep their eyes open! Fresh
air, exercise, and occupation are the best remedies for
keeping them awake.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>MEDICINE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>277. A young wife is usually averse to consult a
medical man concerning several <i>trifling</i> ailments,
which are nevertheless, in many cases, both annoying
and distressing. I have therefore deemed it well to
give a brief account of such <i>slight</i> ailments, and to
prescribe a few <i>safe</i> and <i>simple</i> remedies for them. I
say <i>safe</i> and <i>simple</i>, for <i>active</i> medicines require skillful
handling, and therefore ought not—unless in certain
emergencies—to be used except by a doctor himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>278. I wish it, then, to be distinctly understood that
in all <i>serious</i> attacks, and in <i>slight</i> ailments if not
quickly relieved, a medical man ought to be called in.</p>

<p class='c008'>279. A costive state of the bowels is common in
pregnancy; a <i>mild</i> aperient is therefore occasionally
necessary. The mildest must be selected, as a strong
purgative is highly improper, and even dangerous.
Calomel and all other preparations of mercury are to
be especially avoided, as a mercurial medicine is apt
to weaken the system and sometimes even to produce
a miscarriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>280. An abstemious diet, where the bowels are costive,
is more than usually desirable, for if the bowels
be torpid, a quantity of food will only clog and make
them more sluggish. Besides, when labor comes on,
a loaded state of the bowels will add much to a lady’s
sufferings as well as to her annoyance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>281. The best aperients are castor oil, salad oil, compound
rhubarb pills, honey, stewed prunes, stewed
rhubarb, Muscatel raisins, figs, grapes, roasted apples,
Normandy pippins, oatmeal and milk gruel, coffee,
brown bread and treacle, raw sugar (as a sweetener of
the food), Du Barry’s Arabica Revalenta.</p>

<p class='c008'>282. Castor oil, in pregnancy, is a valuable aperient.
Frequent and small are preferable to occasional and
large doses. If the bowels be constipated (but <i>certainly</i>
not otherwise), castor oil ought to be taken
regularly twice a week. The best time for administering
it is early in the morning. The dose is from a teaspoonful
to a dessertspoonful.</p>

<p class='c008'>283. The best ways of administering it are the following:
Let a wineglass be well rinsed out with
water, so that the sides may be well wetted; then, let
the wineglass be half filled with cold water, fresh from
the pump. Let the necessary quantity of oil be now
carefully poured into the center of the wineglass,
taking care that it does not touch the sides; and if the
patient will, thus prepared, drink it off at one draught,
she will scarcely taste it. Another way of taking it
is, swimming on warm new milk. A third <i>and a good
method</i> is, floating on <i>warm</i> coffee; the coffee ought,
in the usual way, to be previously sweetened and
mixed with cream. There are two advantages in giving
castor oil on coffee: (1) it is a pleasant way of
giving it—the oil is scarcely tasted; and (2) the coffee
itself, more especially if it be sweetened with <i>raw</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>sugar, acts as an aperient; less castor oil, in consequence,
being required; indeed, with many patients
the coffee, sweetened with <i>raw</i> sugar, alone is a sufficient
aperient. A fourth and an agreeable way of administering
it is on orange-juice—swimming on the
juice of one orange.</p>

<p class='c008'>284. Some ladies are in the habit of taking it on
brandy and water; but the spirit is apt to dissolve
a portion of the oil, which afterwards rises in the
throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>285. If <i>salad oil</i> be preferred, the dose ought to be
as much again as of castor oil; and the patient should,
during the day she takes it, eat either a fig or two, or a
dozen or fifteen of stewed prunes, or of stewed French
plums, as salad oil is much milder in its effects than
castor oil.</p>

<p class='c008'>286. Where a lady cannot take oil, one or two compound
rhubarb pills may be taken at bedtime; or a
Seidlitz powder early in the morning, occasionally; or
a quarter of an ounce of <i>tasteless salts</i>—phosphate of
soda—may be dissolved in lieu of table salt, in a cupful
either of soup, or of broth, or of beef-tea, and be
occasionally taken at luncheon.</p>

<p class='c008'>287. When the motions are hard, and when the
bowels are easily acted upon, two, or three, or four
pills made of Castile soap will frequently answer the
purpose; and if they will, are far better than any ordinary
aperient. The following is a good form:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Take of—Castile Soap, five scruples;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Oil of Caraway, six drops:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make twenty-four pills. Two, or three, or four to be taken at
bedtime, occasionally.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>288. A teaspoonful of honey, either eaten at breakfast,
or dissolved in a cup of tea, will frequently
comfortably and effectually open the bowels, and will
supersede the necessity of taking aperient medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>289. A basin of thick Derbyshire oatmeal gruel,
made either with new milk or with cream and water,
with a little salt, makes an excellent luncheon or supper
for a pregnant lady; it is both nourishing and
<i>aperient</i>, and will often entirely supersede the necessity
of giving opening medicine. If she prefers sugar
to salt, let <i>raw</i> sugar be substituted for the salt. The
occasional substitution of coffee for tea at breakfast
usually acts beneficially on the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>290. Let me again urge the importance of a lady,
during the whole period of pregnancy, being particular
as to the state of her bowels, as costiveness is a fruitful
cause of painful, of tedious, and of hard labors. It
is my firm conviction that if a patient who suffers
from constipation were to attend more to the regularity
of her bowels, difficult cases of labor would
rarely occur, more especially if the simple rules of
health were adopted, such as: attention to diet—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>patient partaking of a variety of food, and allowing the
farinaceous, such as oatmeal and the vegetable and
fruit element, to preponderate; the taking of exercise
in the open air; attending to her household duties;
avoiding excitement, late hours, and all fashionable
amusements.</p>

<p class='c008'>291. Many a pregnant lady does not leave the house—she
is a fixture. Can it, then, be wondered at that
costiveness so frequently prevails? Exercise in the
fresh air, and occupation, and household duties are the
best opening medicines in the world. An aperient, let
it be ever so judiciously chosen, is apt, after the effect
is over, to bind up the bowels, and thus to increase the
evil. Now, nature’s medicines,—exercise in the open
air, occupation, and household duties,—on the contrary,
not only at the time open the bowels, but keep up a
proper action for the future: hence their inestimable
superiority.</p>

<p class='c008'>292. Where a lady cannot take medicine, or where
it does not agree with her, a good remedy for constipation
in pregnancy is the <i>external</i> application of castor
oil—castor oil as a liniment—to the bowels The
bowels should be well rubbed every night and morning
with the castor oil. This, if it succeed, will be an
agreeable and safe method of opening the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>293. Another excellent remedy for the costiveness
of pregnancy is an enema, either of warm water or of
Castile soap and water, which the patient, by means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of a self-injecting enema apparatus, may administer to
herself. The quantity of warm water to be used is
from half a pint to a pint; the proper heat is the temperature
of new milk; the time for administering it
is early in the morning, twice or three times a week.
The advantages of clysters are, they never disorder
the stomach—they do not interfere with the digestion—they
do not irritate the bowels—they are given with
the greatest facility by the patient herself—and they
do not cause the slightest pain. If an enema be used
to open the bowels, it may be well to occasionally give
one of the aperients recommended above, in order, if
there be costiveness, to insure a thorough clearance of
the <i>whole</i> of the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>294. If the bowels should be opened once every day,
it would be the height of folly for a pregnant lady to
take either castor oil or any other aperient. She ought
then to leave her bowels undisturbed, as the less medicine
she takes the better. If the bowels be daily and
properly opened, aperients of any sort whatever would
be highly injurious to her. The plan in this, as in all
other cases, is to leave well alone, and never to give
physic for the sake of giving it.</p>

<p class='c008'>295. <i>Diarrhœa.</i>—Although the bowels in pregnancy
are generally costive, they are sometimes in an opposite
state, and are relaxed. Now, this relaxation is frequently
owing to their having been too much constipated,
and nature is trying to relieve itself by purging.
Such being the case, a patient ought to be careful how,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>by the taking of chalk and of astringents, she interferes
with the relaxation.</p>

<p class='c008'>296. The fact is, that in all probability there is something
in the bowels that wants coming away, and nature
is trying all she can to afford relief. Sometimes,
provided she is not unnecessarily interfered with, she
succeeds; at others, it is advisable to give a mild aperient
to help nature in bringing it away.</p>

<p class='c008'>297. When such be the case, a gentle aperient, such
as either castor oil or rhubarb and magnesia, ought to
be chosen. If castor oil, a teaspoonful or a dessertspoonful,
swimming on a little new milk, will generally
answer the purpose. If rhubarb and magnesia be the
medicine selected, then a few doses of the following
mixture will usually set all to rights:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powdered Turkey Rhubarb, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Carbonate of Magnesia, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Essence of Ginger, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Compound Tincture of Cardamoms, half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Peppermint Water, five ounces and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Two tablespoonfuls of the mixture to be taken three times a day,
first shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>298. The diet ought to be simple, plain, and nourishing,
and should consist of beef-tea, of chicken-broth,
of arrow-root, and of well-made and well-boiled oatmeal
gruel. Meat, for a few days, ought not to be
eaten; and stimulants of all kinds must be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>299. If the diarrhœa be attended with pain in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>bowels, a flannel bag filled with hot table salt, and then
applied to the part affected, will afford great relief. A
hot-water bag, too, in a case of this kind, is a great
comfort.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> The patient ought, as soon as the diarrhœa
has disappeared, gradually to return to her usual diet,
provided it be plain, wholesome, and nourishing. She
should pay particular attention to keeping her feet
warm and dry; and, if she be much subject to diarrhœa,
she ought to wear around her bowels, and next to her
skin, a broad flannel belly-band.</p>

<p class='c008'>300. <i>Heartburn</i> is a common and often a distressing
symptom of pregnancy. The acid producing the heartburn
is frequently much increased by an overloaded
stomach. The patient labors under the mistaken notion
that, as she has two to sustain, she requires more
food during this than at any other time; she consequently
is induced to take more than her appetite demands,
and more than her stomach can digest;—hence
heartburn, indigestion, etc. are caused, and her unborn
babe, as well as herself, is thereby weakened.</p>

<p class='c008'>301. An abstemious diet ought to be strictly observed.
Great attention should be paid to the <i>quality</i>
of the food; greens, pastry, hot buttered toast, melted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>butter, and everything that is rich and gross, ought to
be carefully avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>302. Either a teaspoonful of Henry’s magnesia, or
half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda—the former to
be preferred if there be constipation—should occasionally
be taken in a wineglassful of warm water. If
these do not relieve—the above directions as to diet
having been strictly attended to—the following mixture
ought to be tried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Sesquicarbonate of Ammonia, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Bicarbonate of Soda, a drachm and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, eight ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a mixture. Two tablespoonfuls to be taken twice or three
times a day, until relief be obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chalk is sometimes given in heartburn, but as it produces
costiveness, it ought not in such a case to be
used.</p>

<p class='c008'>303. <i>Piles</i> are a common attendant upon pregnancy.
They are small, soft, spongy, dark-red tumors, about
the size either of a bean or of a cherry—they are sometimes
as large as a walnut—and are either within or
around the fundament; they are then, according to
their situation, called either <i>internal</i> or <i>external</i> piles—they
may be either <i>blind</i> or <i>bleeding</i>. If the latter,
blood may be seen to exude from them, and blood will
come away every time the patient has a stool; hence
the patient ought to be as quick as possible over relieving
her bowels, and should not at such times sit
one moment longer than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>304. When the pile or piles are very large, they
sometimes, more especially when she has a motion,
drag down a portion of the bowel, which adds much to
her sufferings.</p>

<p class='c008'>305. If the bowel should protrude, it ought, by means
of the patient’s index finger, to be immediately and
carefully returned, taking care, in order that it may not
scratch the bowel, that the nail be cut close.</p>

<p class='c008'>306. Piles are very painful and are exceedingly sore,
and cause great annoyance, and frequently continue,
notwithstanding proper and judicious treatment, during
the whole period of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>307. A patient is predisposed to piles from the womb
pressing upon the blood-vessels of the fundament. They
are excited into action by her neglecting to keep her
bowels gently opened, or by diarrhœa, or from her
taking too strong purgatives, especially pills containing
either aloes or colocynth, or both.</p>

<p class='c008'>308. If the piles be inflamed and painful, they ought,
by means of a sponge, to be well fomented three times
a day, and for half an hour each time, with hot chamomile
and poppy-head tea;<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> and at bedtime a hot white-bread
poultice should be applied.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>309. Every time after and before the patient has a
motion, she had better well anoint the piles and the
fundament with the following ointment:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Camphor (powdered by means of a few drops of</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Spirits of Wine), half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Prepared Lard, two ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix, to make an ointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>310. If there be great irritation and intense pain, let
some very hot water be put into a close stool, and let
the patient sit over it. “In piles attended with great
irritation and pain, much relief is often obtained by
sitting over the steam of hot water for fifteen or twenty
minutes, and immediately applying a warm bread-and-milk
poultice. These measures should be repeated five
or six times a day (Greeves).”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>311. If the heat be not great, and the pain be not
intense, the following ointment will be found efficacious:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powdered Opium, one scruple;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Camphor (powdered by means of a few drops of</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Spirits of Wine), half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Powdered Galls, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Spermaceti Ointment, three drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix.—The ointment to be applied to the piles three times a day.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
Or the compound Gall Ointment (B.P.) may, in the same manner,
be applied.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>312. If the heat and the pain be great, the following
liniment will be found useful:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—French Brandy,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Glycerin, of each, half an ounce:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix.—The liniment to be frequently applied, by means of a camel’s-hair
pencil, to the piles, first shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>313. The bowels ought to be kept gently and regularly
opened, either by taking every morning one or
two teaspoonfuls of compound confection of senna, or
by a dose of the following electuary:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Sublimed Sulphur, half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Powdered Ginger, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Cream of Tartar, half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Confection of Senna, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, a sufficient quantity:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make an electuary. One or two teaspoonfuls to be taken early
every morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>314. Magnesia and milk of sulphur is an excellent
remedy for piles:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Carbonate of Magnesia,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Milk of sulphur, of each, three drachms;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix.—To make nine powders. One to be taken early every, or
every other morning, mixed in half a teaspoonful of new milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>315. Remember, in these cases, it is necessary to
keep the motions in a <i>softened</i> state, as <i>hard</i> lumps of
stool would, in passing, give intense pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>316. If the confection of senna and the other remedies
do not act sufficiently, it may be well to give, once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>or twice a week, a teaspoonful or a dessertspoonful of
castor oil.</p>

<p class='c008'>317. In piles, if they are not much inflamed, and
provided there be constipation, a pint of tepid water,
administered early every morning as an enema, will
be found serviceable. Care and gentleness ought, of
course, to be observed in introducing the enema pipe
(but which only requires ordinary care), in order not
to press unduly on the surrounding piles.</p>

<p class='c008'>318. The patient ought to lie down frequently in the
day. She will derive great comfort from sitting either
on an air-cushion or on a water-cushion about half
filled with water, placed on the chair; for sometimes
she is unable to sit on an ordinary seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>319. In piles, the patient ought to live on a plain,
nourishing, simple diet, but should avoid all stimulants;
any food or beverage that will inflame the blood
will likewise inflame the piles.</p>

<p class='c008'>320. Piles in pregnancy are frequently troublesome,
and sometimes resist all treatment until the patient is
confined, when they generally get well of themselves;
but still the remedies recommended above will usually
afford great relief, even if they do not effect a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>321. <i>Swollen legs from enlarged veins (varicose
veins).</i>—The veins are frequently much enlarged and
distended, causing the legs to be greatly swollen and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>very painful, preventing the patient from taking proper
walking exercise. Swollen legs are owing to the
pressure of the womb upon the blood-vessels above.
Women who have had large families are more liable
to varicose veins than others. If a lady marry late in
life, or if she be very heavy in her pregnancy—carrying
the child low down—she is more likely to have the
veins to distend.</p>

<p class='c008'>322. The best plan will be for her to wear an elastic
silk stocking,<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> which ought to be made on purpose for
her, in order that it may properly fit the leg and foot.
It will draw on like a common stocking. She ought
to wear a <i>gauze</i> stocking next the skin, and the <i>elastic</i>
stocking over it, as the gauze stocking can then, from
time to time, be washed, as can likewise the foot and
leg. Moreover, the gauze stocking will be more comfortable
next the skin than the elastic stocking.</p>

<p class='c008'>323. If the varicose veins should be very painful,
she had better apply to a medical man, as it may be
necessary, in such a case, to have them enveloped in
mild plasters, and then rolled.</p>

<p class='c008'>324. If the feet and legs be cold as well as swollen,
a <i>domette</i><a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a> bandage, two inches and a half wide and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>eight yards long, nicely applied to each leg, from the
toes to the knee, will be found a great comfort. One
great advantage that domette has over calico is that it
will keep in its place for days, while calico will be
loose in an hour or two.</p>

<p class='c008'>325. <i>Stretching of the skin of the belly</i> is frequently,
especially in a first pregnancy, distressing, from the
soreness it causes. The best remedy is to rub the
bowels, every night and morning, with warm camphorated
oil, and to apply a broad <i>flannel</i> belt, which should
be put on moderately but comfortably tight. The belt
ought to be secured in its situation by means of properly
adjusted tapes.</p>

<p class='c008'>326. <i>If the skin of the belly</i>, from the violent stretching,
<i>be cracked</i>, the patient had better dress the part
affected, every night and morning, with equal parts of
simple cerate and of lard—lard without salt—well mixed
together, spread on lint; which ought to be kept in its
place by means of a broad bandage, similar to the one
used in confinements, and which is described in a subsequent
paragraph (<i>Bandage after Confinements</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>321. <i>Pendulous belly.</i>—A lady sometimes, from being
at these times unusually large, suffers severely; so
much so, that she cannot, without experiencing great
inconvenience, move about. This, where a patient is
stout, and where she has had a large family of children,
is more likely to occur, and especially if she has neglected
proper bandaging after her previous confinements.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>328. She ought in such a case to procure, from a surgical-instrument-maker,
an elastic abdominal belt, made
purposely for pendulous bellies, which will, without
unduly pressing on the belly, be a support. It is a
good plan to have the belt made either to lace behind
or with straps and buckles, in order to accommodate
the belly to its gradually increasing size.</p>

<p class='c008'>329. If the patient be delicate, and if she has a languid
circulation, she ought, instead of the elastic belt,
to apply a broad flannel belly-band, which should go
twice around the bowels, and must be put on moderately
and comfortably tight.</p>

<p class='c008'>330. The patient, <i>before the approach of labor</i>, ought
to take particular care to have the bowels <i>gently</i> opened,
as during that time a costive state of them greatly increases
her sufferings, and lengthens the period of her
labor. I say a <i>gentle</i> action is all that is necessary; a
<i>violent</i> one would do more harm than good.</p>

<p class='c008'>331. <i>Toothache</i> is a frequent complaint of pregnancy;
and I wish to caution my gentle reader not to have,
during the time she is <i>enceinte</i>, a tooth extracted; miscarriage
or premature labor has frequently followed
the extraction of a tooth.</p>

<p class='c008'>332. If the tooth be decayed, the hollow ought to be
filled with cotton wool, soaked either in oil of cloves,
or in equal parts of oil of cloves and of chloroform, and
which should be frequently renewed; or with what I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>have found an excellent remedy, a little alum dissolved
in chloroform.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> A bit of cotton wool placed in the ear
of the affected side will oftentimes relieve the toothache
arising from a decayed tooth. This simple remedy
ought always to be tried before resorting to more active
treatment. If the above remedies do not relieve, soak
a small ball of cotton wool in chloroform, and insert it
inside the ear, and let it remain there until the pain be
relieved; let it be from time to time renewed. I have
frequently found in toothache the above plan most
efficacious, and to afford relief when other means have
failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>333. Creasote (spirits of tar) is sometimes applied,
but of all remedies it is the worst for the purpose. I
have known it, when thus used, severely injure and
decay the whole of the remaining teeth: one case in
particular I remember, of a gentleman who, by the frequent
use of creasote, for the relief of toothache, lost
the whole of his teeth!</p>

<p class='c008'>334. If the teeth be not decayed, especially if the
stomach be disordered, let an aperient be taken. The
state of the bowels ought always to be attended to, as
toothache is frequently relieved, and when the tooth is
not decayed, cured by a dose of opening medicine. Let
the sides of the face be well fomented with hot chamomile
and poppy-head tea, and let a piece of crumb of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>bread (but not crumbed bread) be soaked for five minutes
in boiling milk, and be frequently placed inside the
mouth, between the cheek and gum; and let a large hot
bread poultice be applied at bedtime to the outside of
the face.</p>

<p class='c008'>335. If the above does not have the desired effect, a
piece of brown paper, the size of the palm of the hand,
soaked in brandy, and then well peppered with black
pepper, should be applied outside the cheek, over the
part affected, and kept on for several hours. It ought
from time to time to be renewed. This simple and
old-fashioned remedy will sometimes afford great relief.
It is in these cases preferable to a mustard poultice,
as it is less painful, and neither blisters nor injures
the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>336. If the pepper plaster does not afford relief, a
ginger plaster should be tried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powdered Ginger,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Flour, of each one tablespoonful;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, a sufficient quantity:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To be well mixed together, adding the water drop by drop (stirring
it the while) until it be of the consistence of paste. Let it be
applied at bedtime, on linen rag, <i>outside</i> the cheek, and let it
remain on all night, or until the pain be relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>337. If the tooth be not decayed, and if the pain of
the face be more of a neuralgic (tic-douloureux) character,
the following pills will frequently afford great
relief:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Take of—Sulphate of Quinine, twenty-four grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Powdered Extract of Liquorice, six grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Treacle, a sufficient quantity:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make twelve pills. One to be taken three times a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>338. The teeth, in pregnancy, are very apt to decay:
I have known several patients, each of whom has lost
a tooth with every child!</p>

<p class='c008'>339. <i>Morning sickness.</i>—It is said to be “morning,”
as in these cases, unless the stomach be disordered, it
seldom occurs during any other part of the day. Morning
sickness may be distinguished from the sickness of
a disordered stomach by the former occurring only
early in the morning, on the first sitting up in bed, the
patient during the remainder of the day feeling quite
free from sickness, and generally being able to eat and
relish her food as though nothing ailed her.</p>

<p class='c008'>340. Morning sickness begins with a sensation of
nausea <i>early</i> in the morning, and as soon as she rises
from bed she feels sick and retches; and sometimes,
but not always, vomits a little sour, watery, glairy
fluid; and occasionally, if she has eaten heartily at
supper the night previously, the contents of the stomach
are ejected. She then feels all right again, and is
usually ready for her breakfast, which she eats with
her usual relish. Many ladies have better appetites
during pregnancy than at any other period of their
lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>341. The sickness of a disordered stomach unaccompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>with pregnancy may be distinguished from
morning sickness by the former continuing during the
whole day, by the appetite remaining bad after the
morning has passed, by a disagreeable taste in the
mouth, and by the tongue being generally furred.
Moreover, in such a case there is usually much flatulence.
The patient not only feels but looks bilious.</p>

<p class='c008'>342. If the stomach be disordered during pregnancy,
there will, of course, be a complication of the symptoms,
and the morning sickness may become both day
and night sickness. Proper means ought then to be
employed to rectify the disordered stomach, and the
patient will soon have only the morning sickness to
contend against; which latter, after she has quickened,
will generally leave of its own accord.</p>

<p class='c008'>343. Morning sickness is frequently a distressing,
although not a dangerous complaint. It is only distressing
while it lasts, for after the stomach is unloaded,
the appetite generally returns, and the patient
usually feels, until the next morning, quite well again,
when she has to go through the same process as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>344. It occurs both in the early and in the latter
months of pregnancy; more especially during the former,
up to the period of quickening, <i>at which time it
usually ceases</i>. Morning sickness is frequently the
<i>first</i> harbinger of pregnancy, and is looked upon by
many ladies who have had children as a sure and certain
sign. Morning sickness does not always occur in
pregnancy; some women, at such times, are neither
sick nor sorry.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>345. A good way to relieve it is by taking, <i>before
rising in the morning</i>, a cup of strong coffee. If this
should not have the desired effect, she ought to try an
effervescing draught:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Bicarbonate of Potash, one drachm and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, eight ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Two Tablespoonfuls of this mixture to be taken with one of
lemon-juice every hour, while effervescing, until relief be
obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>346. A glass of champagne, taken the overnight, I
have sometimes found to be the best remedy, and, if it
has the desired effect, it certainly is the most agreeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>347. I have known, too, cider, where other things
have failed, to succeed in abating morning sickness.</p>

<p class='c008'>348. Sometimes, until the whole contents of the
stomach be brought up, she does not obtain relief from
her sickness. She had better, when such is the case,
drink <i>plentifully of warm water</i>, in order to encourage
free vomiting. Such a plan, of course, is only advisable
when the morning sickness is <i>obstinate</i>, and when
the treatment recommended above has failed to afford
relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>349. The morning sickness, during the early months,
is caused by sympathy between the stomach and the
womb; and during the latter months by pressure of
the upper part of the womb against the stomach. As
we cannot remove the sympathy and the pressure, we
cannot always relieve the sickness; the patient, therefore,
is sometimes obliged to bear with the annoyance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>350. The bowels ought to be kept gently opened,
either by a Seidlitz powder taken early in the morning,
or by one or two compound rhubarb pills at bedtime,
or by the following mixture:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Carbonate of Magnesia, two drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Sulphate of Magnesia, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Peppermint water, seven ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>A wineglassful of this mixture to be taken early in the morning,
occasionally, first shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>351. Great attention ought in such a case to be paid
to the diet; it should be moderate in quantity, and
simple in quality. Rich dishes, highly-seasoned soups
and melted butter must be avoided. Hearty meat
suppers ought not on any account to be allowed.
There is nothing better, if anything be taken at night,
than either a teacupful of nicely-made and well-boiled
oatmeal gruel, or of arrow-root, or of Arabica Revalenta.
Any of the above may be made either with
water, or with new milk, or with cream and water.</p>

<p class='c008'>352. It is an old saying, and, I believe as a rule, a
true one, “that sick pregnancies are safe,” more especially
if the sickness leaves, which it generally does,
after she has quickened. The above remarks, of course,
do not include obstinate, inveterate vomiting, occasionally
occurring in the <i>latter</i> period of pregnancy,
and which not only takes place in the morning, but
during the whole of the day and of the night, and for
weeks together, sometimes bringing a patient to the
brink of the grave. Such a case, fortunately, is extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>rare. Another old and generally true saying
is, “that females who have sick pregnancies seldom
miscarry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>353. <i>Means to harden the nipples.</i>—A mother, especially
with her first child, sometimes suffers severely
from sore nipples. Such suffering may frequently be
prevented, if for six weeks or two months before her
confinement, she were to bathe her nipples, every night
and morning, for five minutes each time, either with
<i>eau de Cologne</i>, or with brandy and water, equal parts
of each. The better plan will be to have the brandy
and water in a small bottle ready for use, and putting
a little each time into a teacup, using it fresh and fresh.
A soft piece of fine old linen rag should be used for the
purpose of bathing. All pressure ought to be taken
from the nipples; if the stays, therefore, unduly press
them, either let them be enlarged or let them be entirely
removed. The nipples themselves ought to be covered
with a soft linen rag, as the friction of a flannel vest
would be apt to irritate them. Let me recommend
every pregnant lady, <i>more especially in her first pregnancy</i>,
to adopt either the one or the other of the above
plans to harden the nipples; it might avert much misery,
as sore nipples are painful and distressing; and prevention
at all times is better than cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>354. The <i>breasts are</i>, at times, during pregnancy,
<i>much swollen and very painful</i>; and, now and then,
they cause the patient great uneasiness, as she fancies
that she is going to have either some dreadful tumor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>or a gathering of the bosom. There need, in such a
case, be no apprehension. The swelling and the pain
are the consequences of the pregnancy, and will in due
time subside without any unpleasant result. The fact
is, great changes are taking place in the breasts; they
are developing themselves, and are preparing for the
important functions they will have to perform the moment
the labor is completed.</p>

<p class='c008'>355. <i>Treatment.</i>—She cannot do better than, every
night and morning, to well rub them with equal parts
of <i>eau de Cologne</i> and of olive oil, and to wear a piece
of new flannel over them; taking care to cover the
nipples with soft linen, as the friction of the flannel
may irritate them. The liniment encourages a little
milky fluid to ooze out of the nipple, which will afford
relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>356. If stays be worn, the patient should wear them
slack, in order to allow the bosoms plenty of room to
develop themselves. The bones of the stays ought all
to be removed, or serious consequences might ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>357. <i>Bowel complaints</i>, during pregnancy, are not
unfrequent. A dose either of rhubarb and magnesia,
or of castor oil, are the best remedies, and are generally,
in the way of medicine, all that is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>358. The diet at such times ought to be simple,
small in quantity, and nourishing. Farinaceous food,
such as rice, tapioca, sago, Du Barry’s Arabica Revalenta,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and arrow-root, are particularly beneficial. Green
vegetables and fruits, especially stone fruits and uncooked
fruits, ought to be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>359. The surface of the body—the bowels and feet
particularly—ought to be kept warm. If a lady suffer
habitually from relaxation of the bowels, let her, by
all means, wear a flannel vest next the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>360. <i>The bladder.</i>—The patient during pregnancy is
liable to various affections of the bladder. There is
sometimes a <i>sluggishness</i> of that organ, and she has
little or no inclination to make water. There is, at another
time, a great <i>irritability</i> of the bladder, and she
is constantly wanting to pass urine; while, in a third
case, more especially toward the latter period of the
time, she can scarcely <i>hold her water</i> at all,—the
slightest bodily exertion, such as walking, stooping,
coughing, sneezing, etc., causing it to come away involuntarily;
and even in some cases, where she is perfectly
still, it dribbles away without her having any
power to prevent its doing so.</p>

<p class='c008'>361. <i>A sluggish state of the bladder</i> is best remedied
by gentle exercise, and by the patient attempting,
whether she want or not, to make water at least every
four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>362. <i>Irritability of the bladder.</i>—The patient ought,
during the day, to drink freely of the following beverage:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Take of—Best Gum Arabic, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Pearl Barley, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, one pint and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Boil for a quarter of an hour, then strain, and sweeten either with
sugar candy or lump sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>363. The bowels ought to be gently opened with
<i>small</i> doses of castor oil. The patient must abstain
from beer, wine, or spirits, and should live on a mild,
bland, nourishing diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>364. <i>Where the patient cannot hold her water</i> there
is not a great deal to be done, as the pregnant womb
by pressing on the bladder prevents much present relief.
The comfort is, as soon as the labor is over, it will cure
itself. She ought frequently in the day to lie down
either on a horse-hair mattress or on a couch. She
should drink but a moderate quantity of liquid, and if
she has a cough (for a cough greatly increases this inability
to hold the water), she ought to take the following
mixture:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Compound Tincture of Camphor, half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Compound Spirits of Lavender, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Oxymel of Squills, six drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, six ounces and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Two tablespoonfuls of this mixture to be taken three times a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>365. <i>Fainting.</i>—A delicate woman, when she is <i>enceinte</i>,
is apt either to feel faint or to actually faint
away. When it is considered the enormous changes
that, during pregnancy, take place, and the great
pressure there is upon the nerves and the blood-vessels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>it is not at all surprising that she should do so.
There is one consolation, that although fainting at such
times is disagreeable, it is not at all dangerous, unless
the patient be really laboring under a disease of the
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>366. <i>Treatment.</i>—If the patient feel faint, she ought
<i>immediately</i> to lie down flat upon her back, without a
pillow under her head; that is to say, her head should
be on a level with her body. The stays and any tight
articles of dress—if she has been foolish enough to
wear either tight stays or tight clothes—ought to be
loosened; the windows should be thrown wide open;
water ought to be sprinkled on her face; and sal-volatile—a
teaspoonful in a wineglassful of water, or a
glass of wine ought to be administered. Smelling-salts
must be applied to the nostrils. The attendants—there
should only be one or two present—should not
crowd around her, as she ought to have plenty of room
to breathe.</p>

<p class='c008'>367. She must, in the intervals, live on a good, light,
generous diet. She should keep early hours, and ought
to sleep in a well-ventilated apartment. The following
strengthening medicine will be found serviceable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Sulphate of Quinine, twelve grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Diluted Sulphuric Acid, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Syrup of Orange-peel, half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, seven ounces and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Two tablespoonfuls of the mixture to be taken three times a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>If she be delicate, a change either to the country, or, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the railway journey be not very long, to the coast, will
be desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>368. A nervous patient during this period is subject
to <i>palpitation of the heart</i>. This palpitation, provided
it occur only during pregnancy, is not dangerous; it
need therefore cause no alarm. It is occasioned by the
pressure of the pregnant womb upon the large blood-vessels,
which induces a temporary derangement of the
heart’s action. This palpitation is generally worse at
night, when the patient is lying down. There is, at
these times, from the position, greater pressure on the
blood-vessels. Moreover, when she is lying down, the
midriff, in consequence of the increased size of the belly,
is pressed upward, and hence the heart has not its
accustomed room to work in, and palpitation is in consequence
the result.</p>

<p class='c008'>369. The best remedies will be either half a teaspoonful
of compound spirits of lavender or a teaspoonful
of sal-volatile in a wineglassful of camphor julep,<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
or a combination of lavender and of sal-volatile:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Compound Spirits of Lavender, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Sal-Volatile, eleven drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix.—A teaspoonful of the drops to be taken occasionally in a
wineglassful of water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>370. These medicines ought to lie on a table by the
bedside of the patient, in order that they may, if necessary,
be administered at once. Brandy is in these cases
sometimes given, but it is a dangerous remedy to administer
<i>every</i> time there is palpitation; while the
lavender and the sal-volatile are perfectly safe medicines,
and can never do the slightest harm.</p>

<p class='c008'>371. Mental emotion, fatigue, late hours, and close
rooms ought to be guarded against. Gentle out-door
exercise, and cheerful but not boisterous company are
desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>372. <i>Cramps</i> of the legs and of the thighs during
the latter period, and especially at night, are apt to
attend pregnancy, and are caused by the womb pressing
upon the nerves which extend to the lower extremities.
<i>Treatment.</i>—Tightly tie a handkerchief folded
like a neckerchief round the limb a little above the part
affected, and let it remain on for a few minutes. Friction
by means of the hand either with opodeldoc or
with laudanum (<i>taking care not to drink it by mistake</i>)
will also give relief. Cramp sometimes attacks either
the bowels or the back of a pregnant woman; when
such is the case, let a bag of hot salt, or a hot-water
bag,<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> or a tin stomach warmer filled with hot water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and covered with flannel, or a stone bottle containing
hot water, wrapped in flannel, be applied over the part
affected; and let either a stone bottle of hot water or
a hot brick, which should be incased in flannel, be
placed to the soles of the feet. If the cramp of the
bowels, of the back, or of the thighs be very severe,
the following mixture will be serviceable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Compound Tincture of Camphor, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Dill Water, five ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>A wineglassful of this mixture to be taken at bedtime occasionally,
and to be repeated, if necessary, in four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>373. “<i>The whites</i>,” during pregnancy, especially
during the latter months, and particularly if the lady
has had many children, are frequently troublesome,
and are, in a measure, owing to the pressure of the
womb on the parts below causing irritation. The best
way, therefore, to obviate such pressure, is for the patient
to lie down a great part of each day either on a
bed or on a sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>374. She ought to retire early to rest; she should
sleep on a horse-hair mattress and in a well-ventilated
apartment, and she must not overload her bed with
clothes. A thick, heavy quilt at these times, and indeed
at all times, is particularly objectionable; the perspiration
cannot pass readily through it as through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>blankets, and thus she is weakened. She ought to live
on plain, wholesome, nourishing food; but she must
abstain from beer and wine and spirits. The bowels
ought to be gently opened by means of a Seidlitz powder,
which should occasionally be taken early in the
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>375. The best application will be, to bathe the parts
with warm fuller’s earth and water, in the proportion
of a handful of <i>powdered</i> fuller’s earth to half a wash-hand-basinful
of warm water; and the <i>internal</i> parts
ought, night and morning, to be bathed with it. If
the fuller’s earth should not have the desired effect,
an alum injection<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a> ought, every night and morning,
by means of an india-rubber vaginal syringe,<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a> to be
syringed up the parts; or fifteen drops of solution of
diacetate of lead should be added to a quarter of a pint
of lukewarm water, and be used in a similar manner
as the alum injection.</p>

<p class='c008'>376. Cleanliness, in these cases, cannot be too
strongly urged. Indeed, every woman, either married
or single, ought, unless special circumstances forbid,
to use either the bidet or a sitz-bath. If she has <i>not</i>
the “whites,” or if she has them only slightly, <i>cold</i>,
quite cold water is preferable to tepid. I should advise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>then, <i>every</i> lady, both married and single, whether
she has the “whites” or not, a regular sitz-bath<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
<i>every morning</i> (except during her “poorly times”)—that
is to say, I should recommend her to sit every morning
in the water (in cold water) for a few seconds, or
while she can count a hundred; throwing the while
either a small blanket or shawl over her shoulders, but
having no other clothing on except slippers on her feet.
She should, for the first few mornings, make the water
lukewarm; but the sooner she can use it cold—quite
cold—the more good it will do her.</p>

<p class='c008'>377. If the above plan were more generally followed,
women of all classes and ages would derive
immense benefit from its adoption, and many serious
diseases would be warded off. Besides, the use of the
sitz-bath, after a time, would be a great comfort and
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c008'>378. Where a lady suffers severely from the
“whites,” she ought to visit the coast. There is
nothing in such cases that generally affords so much
relief as the bracing effects of sea-air. Of course, if
she be pregnant, she ought not to bathe in the sea,
but should, every night and morning, bathe the external
parts with sea water.</p>

<p class='c008'>379. When the patient has been much weakened by
the “whites,” she will derive benefit from a quinine
mixture<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a>—a dose of which ought to be taken twice or
three times a day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>380. <i>Irritation and itching of the external parts.</i>—This
is a most troublesome affection, and may occur at
any time, but more especially during the latter period
of the pregnancy; and as it is a subject that a lady is
too delicate and too sensitive to consult a medical man
about, I think it well to lay down a few rules for her
relief. The misery it entails, if not relieved, is almost
past endurance.</p>

<p class='c008'>381. Well, then, in the first place, let her diet be
simple and nourishing; let her avoid stimulants of all
kinds. In the next place, and this is a most important
item of treatment, let her use a tepid salt and water
sitz-bath.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>382. The way to prepare the bath is to put a large
handful of table salt into the sitz-bath, then to add <i>cold</i>
water to the depth of three or four inches, and sufficient
<i>hot</i> water to make the water <i>tepid</i> or <i>lukewarm</i>. The
patient must sit in the bath; her slippered feet being,
of course, out of the water, and on the ground, and
either a woolen shawl or a small blanket being thrown
over her shoulders: which shawl or blanket ought to
be the only covering she has on the while. She
should remain only for a few seconds, or while she
can count, in the winter, fifty, or the summer, a hundred,
in the bath. Patients generally derive great
comfort and benefit from these salt and water sitz-baths.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>383. If the itching, during the daytime, continue,
the following lotion ought to be used:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Solution of Diacetate of Lead, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Rectified Spirits of Wine, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, one pint:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a lotion. The parts affected to be bathed three or four
times a day with the lotion. Or the parts may be bathed two
or three times a day with equal parts of vinegar and water.</p>

<p class='c008'>384. The external parts, and the passage to the
womb (the vagina), in these cases, are not only <i>irritable</i>
and <i>itching</i>, but are sometimes <i>hot</i> and <i>inflamed</i>,
and <i>are covered either with small pimples</i>, or <i>with a
whitish exudation</i> of the nature of <i>aphtha</i> (thrush),
somewhat similar to the thrush on the mouth of an
infant; then the addition of glycerin to the lotion is a
great improvement, and usually gives immense relief.
Either of the following is a good lotion for the purpose:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Biborate of Soda, eight drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Glycerin five ounces;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, ten ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a lotion. The part affected to be bathed every four
hours with the lotion, first shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Solution of Diacetate of Lead,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Rectified Spirits of Wine, of each, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Glycerin, five ounces;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Rose Water, ten ounces and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a lotion. To be used in the same manner as the preceding
one.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>MISCARRIAGE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>385. <i>If a premature expulsion of the child</i> occur
before the end of the seventh month, it is called either
a <i>miscarriage</i> or an <i>abortion</i>; if between the seventh
month and before the <i>full</i> period of nine months, a
<i>premature labor</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>386. There is a proneness for a young wife to miscarry,
and woe betide her, if she once establish the
<i>habit</i>! for it, unfortunately, often becomes a habit. A
miscarriage is a serious calamity, and should be considered
in that light; not only to the mother herself,
whose constitution frequent miscarriages might seriously
injure, and eventually ruin; but it might rob
the <i>wife</i> of one of her greatest earthly privileges, the
inestimable pleasure and delight of being a <i>mother</i>!</p>

<p class='c008'>387. Now, as a miscarriage may <i>generally</i> be prevented,
it behooves a wife to look well into the matter,
and to study the subject thoroughly for herself, in order
to guard against her <i>first</i> miscarriage; for the <i>first</i> miscarriage
is the one that frequently leads to a <i>series</i>.
How necessary it is that the above important fact
should be borne in mind! How much misery might
be averted; as, then, means would, by avoiding the
usual causes, be taken to ward off such an awful calamity.
I am quite convinced that in the majority of
cases, miscarriages may be prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>388. Hence the importance of a <i>popular</i> work of this
kind, to point out dangers, to give judicious advice,
that a wife may read, ponder over, and “inwardly
digest,” and that she may see the folly of the present
practices that wives—young wives especially—usually
indulge in, and thus, that she may avoid the rocks they
split on, which make a shipwreck of their most cherished
hopes and treasures.</p>

<p class='c008'>389. Let it then be thoroughly understood,—first,
that a miscarriage is very weakening—more weakening
than a labor; and, secondly, that if a lady has once
miscarried, she is more likely to miscarry again and
again; until, at length, her constitution is broken, and
the chances of her having a child become small indeed!</p>

<p class='c008'>390. <i>Causes.</i>—A slight cause will frequently occasion
the separation of the child from the mother, and
the consequent death and expulsion of the fœtus; hence
the readiness with which a lady sometimes miscarries.
The following are the most common causes of a young
wife miscarrying: Taking <i>long</i> walks; riding on horseback;
or over rough roads in a carriage; a <i>long</i> railway
journey; overexerting herself, and sitting up late at
night. Her mind, just after marriage, is frequently too
much excited by large parties, by balls, and concerts.</p>

<p class='c008'>391. The following are, moreover, frequent causes of
a miscarriage: Falls; all violent emotions of the mind,
passion, fright, etc.; fatigue; overreaching; sudden
shocks; taking a wrong step either in ascending or in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>descending stairs; falling down stairs; lifting heavy
weights; violent drastic purgatives; calomel; obstinate
constipation; debility of constitution; consumptive
habit of body; fashionable amusements; dancing; late
hours; tight lacing; indeed, anything and everything
that injuriously affects either the mind or the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>392. The old maxim that “prevention is better than
cure” is well exemplified in the case of a miscarriage.
Let me, then, appeal strongly to my fair reader to do
all that she can, by avoiding the usual causes of a miscarriage
which I have above enumerated, to prevent
such a catastrophe. A miscarriage is no trifling matter;
it is one of the most grievous accidents that can
occur to a wife, and is truly a catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c008'>393. <i>Threatening or warning symptoms of a miscarriage.</i>—A
lady about to miscarry usually, for one or
two days, experiences a feeling of lassitude, of debility,
of <i>malaise</i>, and depression of spirits; she feels as though
she were going to be taken “poorly;” she complains of
weakness and of uneasiness about the loins, the hips,
the thighs, and the lower part of the belly. This is an
important stage of the case, and one in which a judicious
medical man may, almost to a certainty, be able to
stave off a miscarriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>394. <i>More serious, but still only threatening symptoms
of a miscarriage.</i>—If the above symptoms are
allowed to proceed, unchecked and untended, she will,
after a day or two, have a slight show of blood; this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>show may soon increase to a flooding, which will
shortly become clotted. Then, perhaps, she begins for
the first time to dread a miscarriage! There may at
this time be but little pain, and the miscarriage <i>might</i>,
with judicious treatment, be even now warded off. At
all events, if the miscarriage cannot be prevented, the
ill effects to her constitution may, with care, be palliated,
and means may be used to prevent a future miscarriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>395. <i>Decided symptoms of a miscarriage.</i>—If the
miscarriage be still proceeding, a new train of symptoms
develop themselves; pains begin to come on, at
first slight, irregular, and of a “grinding” nature, but
which soon become more severe, regular, and “bearing
down.” Indeed, the case is now a labor in miniature;
it becomes <i><span lang="fr">le commencement de la fin</span></i>; the patient is
sure to miscarry, as the child is now dead, and separated
from its connection with the mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>396. The most usual time for a lady to miscarry is
from the eighth to the twelfth week. It is not, of
course, confined to this period, as during the whole
time of pregnancy there is a chance of a premature
expulsion of the contents of the womb. A miscarriage
<i>before</i> the fourth month is <i>at the time</i> attended with
little danger; although, if neglected, it may <i>forever</i>
injure the constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>397. There is, in every miscarriage, more or less of
flooding, which is <i>the</i> most important symptom. <i>After</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the fourth month it is accompanied with more risk; as
the further a lady is advanced in her pregnancy, the
greater is the danger of <i>increased</i> flooding; notwithstanding,
under judicious treatment, there is every
chance of her doing well.</p>

<p class='c008'>398. A medical man ought in such a case always to
be sent for. There is as much care required in a miscarriage
as, or more than, in a labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>399. <i>If bearing down, expulsive pains</i>—similar to
labor pains—should accompany the flooding; if the
flooding increase, and if large clots come away; if the
breasts become smaller and softer; if there be coldness,
and heaviness, and diminution in the size of the belly;
if the motion of the child (the patient having quickened)
cannot be felt; if there be “the impression of a heavy
mass rolling about the uterus [womb], or the falling of
the uterine tumor from side to side in the abdomen
[belly] as the patient changes her position;”<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> and if
there be an unpleasant discharge, she may rest assured
that the child is dead, and that it is separated from all
connection with her, and that the miscarriage <i>must</i>
proceed, it being only a question of time. Of course,
in such a case—if she has not already done so—she
ought <i>immediately</i> to send for a medical man. A miscarriage
sometimes begins and ends in a few days—five
or six; it at other times continues a fortnight, and
even in some cases three weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>400. <i>Treatment.</i>—If a patient has the slightest
“show,” she ought immediately to confine herself
either to a sofa or she should keep in bed. A soft
feather bed must be avoided; it both enervates the
body and predisposes to a miscarriage. There is nothing
better for her to sleep on than a horse-hair mattress.
She either ought to lie flat upon her back or
should lie upon her side, as it is quite absurd for her
merely to rest her legs and feet, as it is the back and
the belly, not the feet and the legs, that require rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>401. Let her put herself on a low diet, such as on
arrow-root, tapioca, sago, gruel, chicken-broth, tea,
toast and water, and lemonade; and whatever she
does drink ought, during the time of the miscarriage,
to be cold. Grapes, at these times, are cooling and
refreshing.</p>

<p class='c008'>402. The temperature of the bedroom should be
kept cool; and, if it be summer, the window ought to
be thrown open; aperient medicines <i>must</i> be avoided;
and if the flooding be violent, cold water should be
applied externally to the parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>403. Let me strongly urge upon the patient the vast
importance of preserving <i>any</i> and every substance that
might come away, in order that it may be carefully
examined by the medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>404. It is utterly impossible for a doctor to declare
positively that a lady has miscarried, and that all has
properly come away, if he have not had an opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of examining the substances for himself. How often
has a lady declared to her medical man that she has
miscarried, when she has only parted with clots of
blood! Clots sometimes put on strange appearances,
and require a practiced and professional eye to decide
at all times upon what they really are.</p>

<p class='c008'>405. The same care is required <i>after a miscarriage</i>
as after a labor; indeed, a patient requires to be
treated much in the same manner—that is to say, she
ought for a few days to keep her bed, and should live
upon the diet I have recommended after a confinement,
avoiding for the first few days stimulants of all kinds.
Many women date their ill state of health to a <i>neglected</i>
miscarriage; it therefore behooves a lady to
guard against such a catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c008'>406. A patient prone to miscarry, ought, <i>before</i> she
become pregnant again, to use every means to brace
and strengthen her system. The best plan that she
can adopt will be <span class='fss'>TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS</span>, and go to some healthy spot; neither
to a fashionable watering-place nor to a friend’s house,
where much company is kept, but to some quiet country
place; if to a healthy farm-house so much the
better.</p>

<p class='c008'>407. Early hours are quite indispensable. She ought
to lie on a horse-hair mattress, and should have but
scant clothing on the bed. She must sleep in a well-ventilated
apartment. Her diet should be light and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>nourishing. <i>Gentle</i> exercise ought to be taken, which
should alternate with frequent rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>408. Cold ablutions ought every morning to be used,
and the body should be afterward dried with a coarse
cloth. If it be winter, let the water be made tepid
and let its temperature be gradually lowered until it
be used quite cold. A shower-bath is, in these cases,
serviceable; it braces and invigorates the system, and
is one of the best tonics that she can use.</p>

<p class='c008'>409. <i>If she be already pregnant</i> it would not be admissible,
as the shock of the shower-bath would be too
great, and may bring on a miscarriage; but still <i>she
ought to continue the cold ablutions</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>410. A lady who is prone to miscarry, ought, <i>as
soon as she is pregnant</i>, to lie down a great part of
every day; she must keep her mind calm and unruffled;
she should live on a plain diet; she ought to
avoid wine and spirits and beer; she should retire
early to rest, <i>and she must have a separate sleeping
apartment</i>. She ought as much as possible to abstain
from taking opening medicine; and if she be actually
obliged to take an aperient—for the bowels must not
be allowed to be constipated—she should select the
mildest (such as either castor oil or lenitive electuary
or syrup of senna), and even of these she ought not to
take a larger dose than is absolutely necessary, as a
<i>free</i> action of the bowels is a frequent cause of a miscarriage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>411. The <i>external</i> application of castor oil as a liniment,
and as recommended at page <a href='#Page_144'>144</a>, is a good and
safe remedy for a patient prone to miscarry; and if
sufficiently active, is far preferable to the mildest aperient.
Another great advantage of the <i>external</i> application
of castor oil is, it does not afterward produce
constipation as the <i>internal</i> administration of castor
oil is apt to do. If the <i>external</i> application of castor
oil in the manner advised at page <a href='#Page_144'>144</a> should not have
the desired effect, then an enema—a clyster of warm
water, a pint—ought, in the morning, two or three
times a week to be administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>412. Gentle walking exercise daily is desirable: <i>long</i>
walks and horseback exercise ought to be sedulously
avoided. A trip to the coast, provided the railway
journey be not very long, would be likely to prevent
a miscarriage; although I would not, on any account,
recommend such a patient either to bathe or to sail on
the water, as the shock of the former would be too
great, and the motion of the vessel and the sea-sickness
would be likely to bring on what we are anxious
to avoid.</p>

<p class='c008'>413. As the <i>usual</i> period for miscarrying approaches
(for it frequently comes on at one particular time), let
the patient be more than usually careful; let her lie
down the greatest part of the day; let her mind be
kept calm and unruffled; let all fashionable society and
every exciting amusement be eschewed; let both the
sitting and the sleeping apartments be kept cool and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>well ventilated; let the bowels (if they be costive) be
opened by an enema (if the <i>external</i> application of
castor oil, as before recommended, be not sufficient);
let the diet be simple and yet be nourishing; let all
stimulants, such as beer, wine, and spirits, be at this
time avoided; and if there be the <i>slightest</i> symptoms
of an approaching miscarriage, such as pains in the
loins, in the hips, or in the lower belly, or if there be
the slightest show of blood, let a medical man be <i>instantly</i>
sent for, as he may, at an early period, be able
to ward off the threatened mishap.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>FALSE LABOR PAINS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>414. A lady, especially in her first pregnancy, is
sometimes troubled with <i>spurious labor pains</i>; these
pains usually come on at night, and are frequently
owing to a disordered stomach. They affect the belly,
the back, and the loins; and occasionally they extend
down the hips and the thighs. They attack first one
place and then another; they come on at irregular intervals;
at one time they are violent, at another they
are feeble. The pains, instead of being <i>grinding</i> or
<i>bearing down</i>, are more of a colicky nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>415. Now, as these false pains more frequently occur
in a <i>first</i> pregnancy, and as they are often more violent
two or three weeks toward the completion of the full
time, and as they usually come on either at night or in
the night, it behooves both the patient and the monthly
nurse to be cognizant of the fact, in order that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>may not make a false alarm and summon the doctor
before he is wanted, and when he cannot be of the
slightest benefit to the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>416. It is sometimes stated that a woman has been
in labor two or three weeks before the child was born!
Such is not the fact. The case in question is one probably
of <i>false</i> pains ending in <i>true</i> pains.</p>

<p class='c008'>417. <i>How, then, is the patient to know that the pains
are false and not true labor pains?</i> False labor pains
come on three or four weeks <i>before</i> the full time; true
labor pains <i>at</i> the completion of the full time; false
pains are unattended with “show;” true pains generally
commence the labor with “show;” false pains
are generally migratory—changing from place to place—first
attacking the loins, then the hips, then the
lower portions, and even other portions of the belly—first
one part, then another; true pains generally begin
in the back; false pains commence as spasmodic pains;
true pains as “grinding” pains; false pains come on
at uncertain periods, at one time a quarter of an hour
elapsing, at others, an hour or two hours between each
pain; at one time the pain is sharp, at another trifling;
true pains come on with tolerable regularity, and gradually
increase in severity.</p>

<p class='c008'>418. But remember—the most valuable distinguishing
symptom is the <i>absence</i> of “show” in false labor
pains, and the <i>presence</i> of “show” in true labor pains.
It might be said that “show” does not always usher in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the commencement of labor. Granted; but such cases
are exceedingly rare, and may be considered as the exception
and not the rule.</p>

<p class='c008'>419. <i>Treatment.</i>—A dose of castor oil is generally
all that is necessary; but if the pains still continue,
the patient ought to be abstemious, abstaining for a
day or two from beer and from wine, and rubbing the
bowels every night at bedtime either with camphorated
oil, previously warmed, or with laudanum (taking
care not to drink it by mistake). Either hot salt, in a
flannel bag, or a hot-water bag applied every night at
bedtime to the bowels, frequently affords great relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>420. If the pains be not readily relieved she ought
to send for a medical man. A little appropriate medicine
will soon have the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>421. These <i>false</i> labor pains might go on either for
days, or even for weeks, and at length may terminate
in <i>real</i> labor pains.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>PERIOD OF GESTATION—“THE COUNT.”</h4>

<p class='c018'>422. The period of gestation is usually<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> two hundred
and eighty days—forty weeks—ten lunar or nine calendar
months.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>423. It will be well for a lady, in making her
“count,” to commence her “reckoning” about three
days after the last day of her being “unwell.” The
reason we fix on a woman conceiving a few days after
she has “ceased to be unwell” is that she is more apt
to do so soon after menstruation than at any other
time.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>424. A good plan to make the “reckoning” is as
follows: Let forty weeks and a few days, from the
time specified above, be marked on an almanac, and a
lady will seldom be far from her calculation. Suppose,
for instance, the last day of her “ceasing to be unwell”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>was on January the 15th, she may expect to be
confined very near October 23d.</p>

<p class='c008'>425. Another plan, and one recommended by Dr.
Tanner, to make the “count,” is the following: “To
effect this readily, we cannot do better than follow the
plan of most German obstetricians, who learn the
probable day of delivery thus: the date of the last
menstruation being given, they calculate three months
backward and add seven days. For example, suppose
the 20th January to be the last day of the last
menstrual period, labor will be due about the 27th October—<i>i.e.</i>
on the 280th day.”<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'>BEING OUT IN THE RECKONING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>426. A lady, sometimes, by becoming pregnant while
she is suckling, is put out of her reckoning; not being
unwell at such time, she consequently does not know
how to “count.” She ought, in a case of this kind, to
reckon from the time that she quickens—that is to
say, she must then consider herself nearly half-gone in
her pregnancy, and to be within a fortnight of half
her time; or, to speak more accurately, as soon as she
has quickened, we have reason to believe that she has
gone about one hundred and twenty-four days: she has
therefore about one hundred and fifty-six more days to
complete the period of her pregnancy. Suppose, for
instance, that she first quickened on May the 17th, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>may expect to be confined somewhere near October the
23d. She must bear in mind, however, that she can
never make so correct a “count” from quickening
(quickening takes place at such various periods) as
from the last day of her being “unwell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>427. A lady is occasionally thrown out of her reckoning
by the appearance, the first month after she is
<i>enceinte</i>, of a little “show.” This discharge does not
come from the womb, as that organ is hermetically
sealed; but from the upper part of the vagina, the
passage to the womb, and from the mouth of the womb,
and may be known from the regular menstrual fluid by
its being much smaller in quantity, by its clotting, and
by its lasting generally but a few hours. This discharge,
therefore, ought not to be reckoned in the
“count,” but the one before must be the guide, and the
plan should be adopted as recommended in page <a href='#Page_186'>186</a>,
paragraph 423.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>“IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?”</h4>

<p class='c018'>428. It has frequently been asked, “Can a medical
man tell, before the child is born, whether it will be a
boy or girl?” Dr. F. J. W. Packman, of Wimborne,
answers in the affirmative. “Queen bees lay female
eggs first, and male eggs afterward. In the human
female, conception in the first half of the time between
menstrual periods produces female offspring, and male
in the latter. When a female has gone beyond the
time she calculated upon, it will generally turn out to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>be a boy.”<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a> It is well to say <i>generally</i>, as the foregoing
remarks are not <i>invariably</i> to be depended upon,
as I have had cases to prove. Notwithstanding, I
believe that there is a good deal of truth in Mr. Packman’s
statement.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>MONTHLY NURSE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>429. It is an important, a most important, consideration
to choose a nurse rightly and well.</p>

<p class='c008'>430. A monthly nurse ought to be middle-aged. If
she be young, she is apt to be thoughtless and giggling;
if she be old, she may be deaf and stupid, and
may think too much of her trouble. She should have
calmness and self-possession. She must be gentle,
kind, good-tempered, and obliging, but firm withal, and
she should have a cheerful countenance. “Some seem
by nature to have a vocation for nursing; others not.
Again, nursing has its separate branches; some have
the light step, the pleasant voice, the cheering smile,
the dextrous hand, the gentle touch; others are gifted
in cookery for the sick.”<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a> The former good qualities
are essential to a monthly nurse, and if she can combine
the latter—that is to say, “if she is gifted in
cookery for the sick”—she will, as a monthly nurse,
be invaluable. Unless a woman have the gift of nursing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>she will never make a nurse. “Dr. Thynne held that
sick-nurses, like poets, were born, not made.”<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>431. She ought neither to be a tattler, nor a tale-bearer,
nor a “croaker,” nor a “potterer.” A tattler
is an abomination; a clacking tongue is most wearisome
and injurious to the patient. A tale-bearer is to
be especially avoided; if she tell tales of her former
ladies, my fair reader may depend upon it that her turn
will come.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> But of all nurses to be shunned as the
plague is the “croaker,” one that discourses of the
dismal and of the dreadful cases that have occurred in
her experience, many of which, in all probability, she
herself was the cause of. She is a very upas-tree in a
house. A “potterer” should be banished from the
lying-in room; she is a perpetual worry—a perpetual
blister! She is a nurse without method, without system,
and without smartness. She potters at this and
potters at that, and worries the patient beyond measure.
She dreams, and drawls, and “potters.” It is
better to have a brusque and noisy nurse than a pottering
one—the latter individual is far more irritating to
the patient’s nerves, and is aggravating beyond endurance.
“There is one kind of nurse that is not uncommon
in hospitals [and in lying-in rooms], and that
gives more trouble and worry than all the others together,
viz., the ‘pottering’ nurse. Of all nuisances,
defend us from a potterer.... The woman always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>has the very best intentions in the world, but is
totally devoid of method and smartness. You never
know when she has begun anything, and you certainly
will never know when she has finished it. She never
does finish it, but she sometimes leaves off....
She seems incapable of taking in a complete and accurate
idea of anything, and even while you are speaking
to her it is easy to see that her attention cannot be
concentrated, and that her mind is flying about among
half a dozen subjects. If she is in the least hurried,
she loses what little intellect she ordinarily possesses,
moans feebly in a <i>sotto voce</i> monotone, fetches the
wrong articles, does the wrong thing at the wrong
time, and is always in the way.”<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>432. Some monthly nurses have a knack of setting
the servants at loggerheads, and of poisoning the
minds of their mistresses toward them. They are
regular mischief-makers, and frequently cause old and
faithful domestics to leave their situations. It will be
seen, therefore, that it is a momentous undertaking to
choose a monthly nurse rightly and well.</p>

<p class='c008'>433. Fortunately for ladies the class of nurses is
wonderfully improved, and the race of Sairey Gamp
and Betsey Prig is nearly at an end.</p>

<p class='c008'>434. She ought to be either a married woman or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>widow. A single woman cannot so well enter into
the feelings of a lying-in patient, and has not had the
necessary experience. Moreover, a <i>single</i> woman, as
a rule, is not so handy with an infant (more especially
in putting him for the first time to the breast) as a
<i>married</i> woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>435. She must be sober, temperate, and healthy, and
free from deafness and from any defect of vision. She
should have a gentle voice and manner, but yet be
neither melancholy nor hippish. She ought to be fond
of children, and must neither mind her trouble nor
being disturbed at night. She should be a light
sleeper. “Scrupulous attention to cleanliness, freshness,
and neatness” in her own person, and toward
the lady and the infant, are most important requisites.</p>

<p class='c008'>436. A fine lady-nurse that requires to be constantly
waited upon by a servant is not the one that I would
recommend. A nurse should be willing to wait upon
herself, upon her mistress, and upon the baby with
alacrity, with cheerfulness, and without assistance, or
she is not suitable for her situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>437. As the nurse, if she does her duty, devotes her
time, her talent, and her best energies to the lady and
infant, a mistress ought to be most liberal in the payment
of a monthly nurse. A good one is cheap at
almost any price, while a bad one, though she come
for nothing, is dear indeed. A cheap nurse is frequently
the ruin of the patient’s and of the baby’s
health, and of the peace of a household.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>438. The monthly nurse ought to be engaged <i>early</i>
in the pregnancy, as a <i>good</i> nurse is caught up soon,
and is full of engagements. This is most important
advice. A lady frequently has to put up with an indifferent
nurse from neglecting to engage her betimes.
The medical man at the eleventh hour is frequently
besought to perform an impossibility—to select a <i>good</i>
nurse; and which he could readily have done if time
had been given him to make the selection. Some of
my best nurses are engaged by my patients as early as
two or three months after the latter have conceived,
in order to make sure of having their favorite nurses.
My patients are quite right; a good nurse is quite of
as much importance to her well-doing as a good doctor;
indeed, a <i>bad</i> nurse oftentimes makes a <i>good</i> doctor’s
efforts perfectly nugatory.</p>

<p class='c008'>439. It is always desirable, whenever it be possible,
that the doctor in attendance should himself select the
monthly nurse, as she will then be used to his ways,
and he will know her antecedents—whether she be
sober, temperate, and kind, and that she understands
her business, and whether she be in the habit of attending
and of following out his directions, for frequently
a nurse is self-opinionated, and fancies that she
knows far better than the medical man. Such a nurse
is to be scrupulously avoided. There cannot be two
masters in a lying-in room; if there be, the unfortunate
patient will inevitably be the sufferer. A doctor’s
directions <i>must</i> be carried out to the very letter. It
rests with the patient to select a judicious medical man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>who, although he will be obeyed, will be kind and considerate
to the nurse.</p>

<p class='c008'>440. A monthly nurse ought to be in the house a
week or ten days before the commencement of the
labor, in order that there may be neither bustle nor
excitement, and no hurrying to and fro at the last moment
to find her; and that she may have everything
prepared, and the linen well aired for the coming
event.</p>

<p class='c008'>441. She must never be allowed, unless ordered by
the medical man, to give either the patient or the baby
a particle of medicine. A quacking monthly nurse is
an abomination. An infant who is everlastingly being
drugged by a nurse is sure to be puny and delicate.</p>

<p class='c008'>442. A monthly nurse ought to understand the manner
of putting on and of tightening the bandage after a
confinement. This, every night and morning, she must
do. The doctor generally does it the first time himself,
viz., immediately after the labor. It requires a little
knack, and if the nurse be at all awkward in the matter,
the medical man will only be too happy to show her the
way, for he is quite aware the support, the comfort,
and the advantage it will be to his patient, and he will
be glad to know that the nurse herself will be able to
continue putting it on properly for some weeks—for at
least three weeks—after the lying-in.</p>

<p class='c008'>443. If nurses better understood the proper method
of bandaging patients after their labors, there would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>not be so many ladies with pendulous bellies and with
ungainly figures. It is a common remark that a lady’s
figure is spoiled in consequence of her having had so
many children. This, provided efficient bandaging
after <i>every</i> confinement had been properly resorted to,
ought not to be. But then, if a monthly nurse is to do
those things properly, she ought to be properly trained,
and many of them have little or no training; hence the
importance of choosing one who thoroughly knows and
will conscientiously do her duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>444. A monthly nurse who thoroughly understands
her business will always have the lying-in room tidy,
cheerful, and well ventilated. She will not allow dirty
linen to accumulate in the drawers, in corners, and
under the bed; nor will she allow any chamber utensil
to remain for one moment in the room after it has been
used. If it be winter, she will take care that the fire
in the grate never goes out, and that it is never very
large, and that the room is kept as nearly as possible at
one temperature—namely, at 60° Fahrenheit. She will
use her authority as a nurse, and keep the other children
from frequently running into the room, and from
exciting and disturbing her mistress; and she will make
a point of taking charge of the baby, and of keeping
him quiet while the mother, during the day, is having
her necessary sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>445. A good monthly nurse fully comprehends and
thoroughly appreciates the importance of bathing the
external parts concerned in parturition every night and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>morning, and sometimes even oftener, for at least two
or three weeks after a confinement. And if the medical
man deem it necessary, she ought to understand the
proper manner of using a vaginal syringe. If the
nurse be self-opinionated, and tries to persuade her
mistress not to have proper ablution—that such ablution
will give cold—she is both ignorant and prejudiced,
and quite unfit for a monthly nurse; and my
advice is, that a lady ought on no account to engage
such a person a <i>second</i> time.</p>

<p class='c008'>446. In another part of this work I have entered
fully on the vital importance of ablution after a confinement,
and I need not say more than again to urge
my fair reader to see that the monthly nurse properly
carries it out, and that, if there be any objections made
to it by the nurse, the medical man be appealed
to in the matter, and that his judgment be final. Assured
I am that every doctor who understands his profession
will agree with me, that the regular ablution
of the parts after a labor is absolutely indispensable.
The nurse, of course, will take care to guard the bed
from being wet, and will not expose the patient unnecessarily
during the process; she will be quick over it,
and she will have in readiness soft, warm, dry towels
to speedily dry the parts that have been bathed. The
above is most important advice, and I hope that my
fair inquirer will engage a monthly nurse that will do
her duty in the matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>447. Before concluding a list of some of the duties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of a monthly nurse, there are four more pieces of advice
I wish to give both to a wife and to a monthly
nurse herself, which are these: (1) Never to allow a
nurse, until she be ordered by the doctor, to give either
brandy, or wine, or porter, or ale to the patient. (2)
I should recommend every respectable monthly nurse
to carry about with her an india-rubber vaginal syringe.
One of the best for the purpose is Higginson’s syringe,<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
which is one constructed to act either as an enema apparatus,
or, by placing the vaginal pipe over the enema
pipe, as a vaginal syringe. She will thus be armed at
all points, and will be ready for any emergency. It is
an admirable invention, and cannot be too well known.
(3) I should advise a monthly nurse while on duty,
whatever she may do at other times, to doff her crinoline.
A woman nursing a baby with a stuck-out crinoline
is an absurdity, and if it were not injurious both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>to the mother and to the infant (as the nurse in crinoline
cannot do her duty either to the one or to the
other) she would be a laughable object. A new-born
baby pillowed in steel! (4) I should recommend
every monthly nurse, while in the lying-in room, to
wear either list slippers or the rubber slippers, as creaking
shoes are very irritating to a patient. “Nurses
at these times should wear slippers and not shoes.
The <i>best</i> slippers in sick-rooms are those manufactured
by the North British Rubber Company, Edinburgh:
they enable nurses to walk in them about the room
without causing the slightest noise; indeed, they may
be called ‘the noiseless slipper’—a great desideratum
in such cases, more especially in all head affections of
children. If the above slippers cannot readily be obtained,
then list slippers—soles and all being made of
list—will answer the purpose equally as well.”<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>PART III.<br> <span class='c016'>LABOR.</span></h3>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'>THE PRECURSORY SYMPTOMS OF LABOR.</h4>

<p class='c018'>448. A day or two before the labor commences, the
patient usually feels better than she has done for a
long time; she is light and comfortable; she is smaller,
and the child is lower down; she is more cheerful,
breathes more freely, and is more inclined to take exercise,
and to attend to her household duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>449. A few days, sometimes a few hours, before
labor commences, the child “falls,” as it is called, that
is to say, there is a <i>subsidence—a dropping—of the
womb</i> lower down the belly. This is the reason why
she feels lighter and more comfortable, and more inclined
to take exercise, and why she can breathe more
freely.</p>

<p class='c008'>450. The only inconvenience of <i>the subsidence of
the womb</i> is that the womb presses on the bladder,
and sometimes causes an irritability of that organ, inducing
a frequent desire to make water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>451. The <i>subsidence—the dropping—of the womb</i>
may then be considered <i>one</i> of the earliest of the <i>precursory
symptoms</i> of <i>the</i> labor, and as <i>the</i> herald of
the coming event.</p>

<p class='c008'>452. She has, at length, slight pains, and then she
has a “show,” as it is called; which is the coming
away of a mucous plug, which, during pregnancy,
had hermetically sealed the mouth of the womb. The
“show” is generally tinged with a little blood. When
a “show” takes place, she may rest assured that labor
has actually commenced. One of the <i>early</i> symptoms
of labor is a frequent desire to relieve the bladder.</p>

<p class='c008'>453. She has now “<i>grinding pains</i>,” coming on at
uncertain periods; sometimes once during two hours,
at other times every hour or half hour. These “grinding
pains” ought not to be interfered with; at this
stage, therefore, it is useless to send for a doctor; yet
the monthly nurse should be in the house, to make
preparations for the coming event. Although, at this
early period, it is <i>not</i> necessary to send for the medical
man, nevertheless, it is well to let him know that his
services might shortly be required, in order that he
might be in the way, or that he might leave word
where he might quickly be found.</p>

<p class='c008'>454. These “grinding pains” gradually assume more
regularity in their character, return at shorter intervals,
and become more severe. About this time, shivering,
in the majority of cases, is apt to occur, so as to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the teeth chatter again. Shivering <i>during labor</i> is
not an unfavorable symptom; it proves, indeed, that
the patient is in real earnest, and that she is making
progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>455. She ought not, on any account, unless it be
ordered by the medical man, to take brandy as a
remedy for the shivering. A cup either of <i>hot</i> tea or
of <i>hot</i> gruel will be the best remedy for the shivering;
and an extra blanket or two should be thrown over
her, which ought to be well tucked around her, in
order to thoroughly exclude the air from the body.
The <i>extra</i> clothing should, as soon as she is warm and
perspiring, be gradually removed, as she ought not to
be kept very hot, or it will weaken her, and will thus
retard her labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>456. <i>Sickness</i> frequently comes on in the beginning
of the labor, and may continue during the whole process.
She is not only sick, but she actually vomits,
and she can keep little or nothing on her stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>457. Now, sickness in labor is rather a favorable
symptom, and is usually indicative of a kind and easy
confinement. There is an old saying that “sick labors
are safe.” Although they may be safe, they are decidedly
disagreeable!</p>

<p class='c008'>458. In such a case there is little or nothing to be
done, as the less an irritable stomach is meddled with
the better. The sickness will probably leave as soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>as the labor is over. Brandy, unless prescribed by the
medical man, ought not to be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>459. She must not, on any account, force down—as
her female friends or as a “pottering” old nurse
may advise to—“grinding pains:” if she do, it will
rather retard than forward her labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>460. She had better, during this stage, either walk
about or sit down, and not confine herself to bed;
indeed, there is no necessity for her, unless she particularly
desire it, to remain in her chamber.</p>

<p class='c008'>461. If, at the commencement of the labor, the
“waters should break,” even if there be no pain, the
medical man ought immediately to be sent for; as, in
such a case, it is necessary that he should know the
exact presentation of the child.</p>

<p class='c008'>462. After an uncertain length of time, the character
of the pains alters. From being “grinding,” they become
“bearing down,” and are now more regular and
frequent, and the skin becomes both hot and perspiring.
These may be considered the <i>true</i> labor
pains. The patient ought to bear in mind then that
“the true labor pains are situated in the back and
loins; they come on at regular intervals, rise gradually
up to a certain pitch of intensity, and abate as gradually;
it is a dull, heavy, deep sort of pain, producing
occasionally a low moan from the patient; not sharp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>or twinging, which would elicit a very different expression
of suffering from her.”<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>463. As soon as the pains assume a “bearing down”
character, the medical man ought to be in attendance;
if he be sent for during the <i>early</i> stage, when the pains
are of a “grinding” character, and when they come on
“few and far between,” and at uncertain intervals
(unless, as before stated, “the waters should break”
early), he can do no good; for if he attempt in the
<i>early</i> stage to force on the labor, he might do irreparable
mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>464. <i>Cramps</i> of the legs and of the thighs are a
frequent, although not a constant, attendant on labor.
These cramps come on more especially if the patient
be kept for a lengthened period in one position; hence
the importance of allowing her, during the first and
the second stages of labor, to move about the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>465. Cramps are generally worse during the third
or last stage of labor, and then, if they occur at all,
they usually accompany each pain. The poor patient,
in such a case, has not only to bear the labor pains but
the cramp pains! Now, there is no danger in these
cramps; it is rather a sign that the child is making
rapid progress, as he is pressing upon the nerves
which supply the thighs.</p>

<p class='c008'>466. The nurse ought to well rub, with her warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>hand, the cramped parts; and, if the labor be not too
far advanced, it would be well for the patient to change
her position, and to sit on a chair, or, if she feel inclined,
to walk about the room; there being of course an attendant,
one on each side, to support her the while. If
either a pain or a cramp should come on while she is
thus moving about, let her instantly take hold of the
bedpost for support.</p>

<p class='c008'>467. I observe, in a subsequent paragraph, that in
a case of labor, a four-post mahogany bedstead without
a foot-board is preferable to either a brass or an
iron bedstead. It will now be seen that this was one
of my reasons for advising the old-fashioned bedstead;
as the support of a bedpost is oftentimes a relief and
a comfort. The new-fashioned mahogany bedsteads
made with <i>fixed</i> foot-board, and both the iron and brass
bedsteads with railings at the foot, are each and all,
during the progress of labor, very inconvenient; as
the patient, with either of these kinds of bedsteads, is
not able to plant her feet firmly against the bedpost—the
foot-board of the former and the railings of the
latter being in the way of her doing so. The man
who invented these new-fangled bedsteads was an
<i>ignoramus</i> in such matters.</p>

<p class='c008'>468. Labor—and truly it may be called “labor”<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a>—is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>a natural process, and therefore ought not unnecessarily
to be interfered with, or woe betide the unfortunate
patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>469. I firmly believe that a woman would stand a
much better chance of getting well over her confinement
<i>without</i> assistance, than if she had been hurried
<i>with</i> assistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>470. In a natural labor very little assistance is
needed, and the doctor is only required in the room
occasionally, to ascertain that things are going on
rightly. Those ladies do best, both at the time and
afterward, whose labors are the least interfered with.
Bear this in mind, and let it be legibly written on your
memory. This advice, of course, only holds good in
natural confinements.</p>

<p class='c008'>471. Meddlesome midwifery cannot be too strongly
reprobated. The duty of a doctor is to watch the progress
of a labor, in order that, if there be anything
wrong, he may rectify it; but if the labor be going on
well, he has no business to interfere, and he need not
be much in the lying-in room, although he should be in
an adjoining apartment.</p>

<p class='c008'>472. These remarks are made to set a lady right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>with regard to the proper offices of an obstetrician; as
sometimes she has an idea that a medical man is able,
by constantly “taking a pain,” to greatly expedite a
natural labor. Now, this is a mistaken and mischievous,
although a popular notion.</p>

<p class='c008'>473. The <i>frequent</i> “taking of a pain” is very injurious
and most unnatural. It irritates and inflames the
passages, and frequently retards the labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>474. The <i>occasional</i>, but only the <i>occasional</i>, “taking
of a pain” is <i>absolutely</i> necessary to enable the medical
man to note the state of the parts, and the progress of
the labor; but the <i>frequent</i> “taking of a pain” is very
objectionable and most reprehensible.</p>

<p class='c008'>475. As a rule, then, it is neither necessary nor desirable
for a medical man to be much in a lying-in
room. Really, in a natural labor, it is surprising how
very little his presence is required. After he has once
ascertained the nature of the case, <i>which it is absolutely
necessary that he should do</i>, and has found all
going on “right and straight,” it is better, much better,
that he retire in the daytime to the drawing-room,
in the night season to a bedroom, and thus to allow
nature time and full scope to take her own course without
hurry and without interference, without let and
without hindrance. Nature hates hurry and resents
interference.</p>

<p class='c008'>476. The above advice, for many reasons, is particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>useful. In the first place, nature is not unnecessarily
interfered with. Secondly, it allows a patient,
from time to time, to empty her bladder and bowels,—which,
by giving more room to the adjacent parts,
greatly assists and expedites the progress of the labor.
Thirdly, if the doctor is not present he is not called
upon to be frequently “taking a pain,” which she may
request him to do, as she fancies it does her good and
relieves her sufferings; but which frequent taking of a
pain in reality does her harm, and retards the progress
of the labor. No; a doctor ought <i>not</i> to be much in a
lying-in room. Although it may be necessary that he
be near at hand, within call, to render assistance toward
the last, I emphatically declare that in an ordinary
confinement—that is to say, in what is called a
natural labor—the only time, as a rule, that the presence
of the doctor can be useful, is <i>just</i> before the child
is born; although he ought to be in readiness, and
should therefore be in the house some little time before
the event takes place. Let the above most important
advice be strongly impressed upon your memory. Oh!
if a patient did but know what a blessed thing is
patience, and, in an ordinary labor, the importance of
non-interference!</p>

<p class='c008'>477. Bear in mind, then, that in every well-formed
woman, and in every ordinary confinement, nature is
perfectly competent to bring, <i>without the assistance of
man</i>, a child into the world, and that it is only an
ignorant person who would, in a natural case of labor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>interfere to assist nature.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Assist nature! Can any
thing be more absurd? As though God in his wisdom,
in performing one of his greatest wonders and
processes, required the assistance of man! It might
with as much truth be said that in every case of the
process of <i>healthy</i> digestion it is necessary for a doctor
to assist the stomach in the process of digesting the
food! No; it is high time that such fallacies were exploded,
and that common sense should take the place
of such folly. A natural labor, then, ought <i>never</i> to
be either hurried or interfered with, or frightful consequences
might, and in all probability will, ensue. Let
every lying-in woman bear in mind that the more patient
she is, the more kind and the more speedy will
be her labor and her “getting about.” Let her, moreover,
remember, then, that labor is a natural process—that
all the “grinding” pains she has are doing her
good service, are dilating, softening, and relaxing the
parts, and preparing for the final or “bearing down”
pains; let her further bear in mind <i>that these pains
must not, on any account whatever, be interfered with</i>
either by the doctor, by the nurse, or by herself. These
pains are sent for a wise purpose, and they ought to be
borne with patience and resignation, and she will in
due time be rewarded for all her sufferings and anxieties
by having a living child. Oh, how often have I
heard an ignorant nurse desire her mistress to bear
down to a “grinding” pain, as though it could do the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>slightest good! No, it only robs her of her strength
and interferes with the process and progress of the
labor. Away with such folly, and let nature assert
her rights and her glorious prerogative! It might be
thought that I am tedious and prolix in insisting on
non-interference in a natural labor, but the subject is of
paramount importance, and cannot be too strongly dwelt
upon, and cannot be too often brought, and that energetically,
before the notice of a lying-in woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>478. Fortunately for ladies, there is great talent in
the midwifery department, which would prevent—however
anxious a patient may be to get out of her trouble—any
improper interference.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>479. I say <i>improper</i> interference. A case sometimes,
<i>although rarely</i>, occurs, in which it might be
necessary for the medical man to properly interfere and
to help the labor; then the patient must leave herself
<i>entirely</i> in the hands of her doctor—to act as he thinks
best, and who may find it necessary to use promptness
and decision, and thus to save her an amount of unnecessary
lingering pain, risk, and anxiety. But these
cases, fortunately, are exceptions—<i>rare exceptions</i>—and
not the rule.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>480. It is, then, absolutely necessary, in some few
cases, that a medical man should act promptly and
decisively; delay in such emergencies would be dangerous:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well</div>
      <div class='line'>It were done quickly.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>481. There are times, and times without number,
when a medical man is called upon to do but little or
nothing; and there are others—few and far between—when
it is imperatively necessary that he should do a
great deal. He ought at all times to be, as gentle as
a lamb, but should, in certain contingencies, be as fearless
as a lion!</p>

<p class='c008'>482. <i>Should the husband be present during the labor?</i>
Certainly not; but as soon as the labor is over, and all
the soiled clothes have been put out of the way, let him
instantly see his wife for a few minutes, to whisper in
her ear words of affection, of gratitude, and consolation.</p>

<p class='c008'>483. The <i>first</i> confinement is generally twice the
length of time of an <i>after</i> one, and usually the more
children a lady has had, the quicker is the labor; but
this is by no means always the case, as <i>some</i> of the <i>after</i>
labors may be the <i>tedious</i>, while the <i>early</i> confinements
may be the <i>quick</i> ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>484. It ought to be borne in mind, too, that <i>tedious
labors</i> are oftentimes <i>natural labors</i>, and that they
only require time and patience from all concerned to
bring them to a successful issue.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>485. It may be said that a <i>first</i> labor, as a rule, lasts
six hours, while an <i>after</i> labor probably lasts but three.
This space of time, of course, does not usually include
the <i>commencement</i> of labor pains, but the time that a
lady may be <i>actually</i> said to be in <i>real</i> labor. If we
are to reckon from the commencement of the labor, we
ought to double the above numbers—that is to say, we
should make the average duration of a first labor
twelve; of an after labor, six hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>486. When a lady marries late in life—for instance,
after she has passed the age of thirty—her <i>first</i> labor
is usually much more lingering, painful, and tedious,
demanding a great stock of patience from the patient,
from the doctor, and from the friends; notwithstanding
which, if she be not hurried and be not much interfered
with, both she and the baby generally do remarkably
well. Supposing a lady marries late in life, it is
only the <i>first</i> confinement that is usually hard and lingering;
the <i>after</i> labors are as easy as though she had
married when young.</p>

<p class='c008'>487. Slow labors are not necessarily dangerous; on
the contrary, a patient frequently has a better and more
rapid recovery, provided there has been no interference,
after a tedious than after a quick confinement—proving
beyond doubt that nature hates hurry and interference.
It is an old saying, and, I believe, a true one, that a lying-in
woman <i>must</i> have pain either <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> a labor;
and it certainly is far preferable that she should have the
pain and suffering <i>before</i> than <i>after</i> the labor is over.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>488. It is well for a patient to know that, as a rule,
after a <i>first</i> confinement she never has after pains.
This is some consolation, and is a kind of compensation
for her usually suffering more with her <i>first</i> child.</p>

<p class='c008'>489. The after pains generally increase in intensity
with every additional child. This only bears out, in
some measure, what I before advanced, namely, that
the pain is less severe and of shorter duration <i>before</i>
each succeeding labor, and that the pain is greater and
of longer duration <i>after</i> each succeeding one.</p>

<p class='c008'>490. The after pains are intended by nature to contract—to
reduce—the womb somewhat to its non-pregnant
size, and to assist clots in coming away, and
therefore ought not to be needlessly interfered with.
A judicious medical man will, however, if the pains be
very severe, prescribe medicine to moderate—not to
stop—them. A doctor fortunately possesses valuable
remedies to alleviate the after pains.</p>

<p class='c008'>491. Nature—beneficent nature—ofttimes works in
secret, and is doing good service by preparing for the
coming event, unknown to all around. In the <i>very
earliest stages of labor</i> pain is not a necessary attendant.</p>

<p class='c008'>492. Although pain and suffering are the usual concomitants
of childbirth, there are, nevertheless, well-authenticated
cases on record of <i>painless parturition</i>.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>493. A natural labor may be divided into three
stages. <i>The first</i>, the premonitory stage, comprising
the “falling” or <i>subsidence of the womb</i>, and the
“show.” <i>The second</i>, the dilating stage, which is
known by the pains being of a “grinding” nature,
and in which the mouth of the womb gradually opens
or dilates until it is sufficiently large to admit the exit
of the head of the child, when it becomes <i>the third</i>, the
completing stage, which is now indicated by the pains
being of a “bearing down” expulsive character.</p>

<p class='c008'>494. Now, in the first or premonitory stage, which
is much the longest of the three stages, it is neither
necessary nor desirable that the patient should be confined
to her room; on the contrary, it is better for her
to be moving about the house, and to be attending to
her household duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>495. In the second or dilating stage, it will be necessary
that she should be confined to her room, but not
to her bed. If the drawing-room be near at hand, she
ought occasionally to walk to it, and if a pain should
come on the while, lie on the sofa. In this stage it is
not at all desirable that she should keep her bed, or
even lie much on it. She is better up and about, and
walking about the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>496. In the first and the second stages she must not,
on any account, strain or bear down to the pains, as
many ignorant nurses advise, as, by robbing her of
her strength, it would only retard the labor. Besides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>while the mouth of the womb is dilating, bearing down
cannot be of the slightest earthly use—the womb is not
in a fit state to expel its contents. If by bearing down
she could (but which fortunately she cannot) cause the
expulsion of the child, it would, at this stage, be attended
with frightful consequences—no less than the
rupture of the womb! Therefore, for the future, let
not a lady be persuaded, either by any ignorant nurse
or by any officious friend, to bear down until the last
or the complete stage, when a gentle bearing down will
assist the pains to expel the child.</p>

<p class='c008'>491. In the third or completing stage, of course it
is necessary that she should lie on a bed, and that she
should, as above advised, bear gently down to the
pains. The <i>bearing</i> down pains will indicate to her
when to <i>bear</i> down.</p>

<p class='c008'>498. If, toward the last, she be in great pain, and if
she feel inclined to do so, let her cry out,<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> and it will
relieve her. A foolish nurse will tell her that if she
make a noise, it will do her harm. Away with such
folly, and have nothing to do with such simpletons!</p>

<p class='c008'>499. Even in the last stage, she ought never to bear
down unless the pain be actually upon her; it will do
her great harm if she does. In bearing down, the plan
is to hold the breath, and strain down as though she
were straining to have a stool.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>500. By a patient adopting the rules just indicated,
much weariness might be avoided; cramp, from her
not being kept long in one position, might be warded
off; the labor, from her being amused by change of
room and scene, might be expedited; and thus the
confinement might be deprived of much of its monotony
and misery.</p>

<p class='c008'>501. Nurses sometimes divide a labor into two
kinds—a “back labor,” and a “belly labor.” The latter
is not a very elegant, although it might be an expressive,
term. Now, in a “back labor,” the patient
will derive comfort by having her back held by the
nurse. This ought not to be done by the <i>bare</i> hand,
but let the following plan be adopted: Let a pillow be
placed next to the back, and then the nurse should apply
firm pressure, the pillow intervening between the
back and the nurse’s hand or hands. If the above
method be followed, the back will not be injured, which
it otherwise would be by the pressure of the hard hand
of the nurse. Where the <i>bare</i> hand alone has been
applied, I have known the back to continue sore and
stiff for days.</p>

<p class='c008'>502. During the latter stage of labor, the patient
ought always to beep her eyelids closed, or the straining
might cause an attack of inflammation of the eyes,
or, at all events, might make them bloodshot.</p>

<p class='c008'>503. Let a large room, if practicable, be selected for
the labor, and let it be airy and well ventilated; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>if it be summer, take care that the chimney be not
stopped. If the weather be intensely hot, there is no
objection to the window being from time to time a little
opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>504. The old-fashioned four-post mahogany bedstead
is the most convenient for a confinement, and is far
preferable either to brass or to iron. The reasons are
obvious: in the first place, the patient can, in the <i>last</i>
stage of labor, press her feet against the bedpost, which
is often a great comfort, relief, and assistance to her.
And secondly, while she is walking about the room,
and “a pain” suddenly comes on, she can, by holding
the bedpost, support herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>505. If there be a straw mattress and a horse-hair
mattress, besides the bed, let the straw mattress be
removed; as a high bed is inconvenient, not only to
the patient, but to the doctor.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>PREPARATIONS FOR LABOR.</h4>

<p class='c018'>506. I should strongly urge a patient <i>not</i> to put
everything off to the last. She must take care to have
in readiness a <i>good</i> pair of scissors and a skein of
whity-brown thread. And she ought to have in the
house a small pot of fresh lard—that is to say, <i>unsalted</i>
lard,<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a> that it may be at hand in case it is wanted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Let everything necessary both for herself and the babe
be well aired and ready for <i>immediate</i> use, and be placed
in such order that all things may, without hurry or
bustle, at a moment’s notice, be found.</p>

<p class='c008'>507. Another preparation for labor, and a most important
one, is, attending to the state of the bowels.
<i>If they are at all costive</i>, the moment there is the
slightest <i>premonitory</i> symptom of labor, she ought to
take either a teaspoonful or a dessertspoonful (according
to the nature of her bowels, whether she be easily
moved or otherwise) of castor oil. If she object to
taking the oil, then let her have an enema of warm
water, a pint, administered. By adopting either of the
above plans she will derive the greatest comfort and
advantage. It will prevent her delicacy from being
shocked by having her bowels opened, without her
being able to prevent them, during the last stage of
labor; and it will, by giving the adjacent parts more
room, much expedite the confinement and lessen her
sufferings.</p>

<p class='c008'>508. The next thing to be attended to is the way in
which she ought to be <i>dressed for the occasion</i>. I
would recommend her to put on her clean night-gown,
which, in order to keep it clean and unsoiled, should
be smoothly and carefully rolled up about her waist;
then she ought to wear over it a short bed-gown reaching
to the hips, and have on a flannel petticoat to meet
it, and then she should put on a dressing-gown over
all. If it be winter, the dressing-gown had better either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>be composed of flannel or be lined with that material.
<i>The stays must not be worn</i>, as they would interfere
with the progress of the labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>509. The valances of the bed, and the carpet, and
the curtains at the foot of the bed, had better all be
removed; they are only in the way, and may get soiled
and spoiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>510. “<i>The guarding of the bed.</i>”—This is done in
the following way: Cover the <i>right</i> side of the bed
(as the patient will have to lie on her <i>left</i> side), with
a large piece—a yard and a half square—of waterproof
cloth, or bed-sheeting, as it is sometimes called, which
is sold for the purpose;<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a> over this, folded sheets ought
to be placed. If a waterproof cloth cannot be procured,
an oil-cloth table-cover will answer the purpose.
Either of the above plans will effectually protect the
bed from injury.</p>

<p class='c008'>511. The lying-in room should be kept not hot, but
comfortably warm; if the temperature of the room be
high, the patient will become irritable, feverish, and
restless.</p>

<p class='c008'>512. Every now and then, in order to change the
air, let the door of the room be left ajar; and if, in the
early periods of the labor, she should retire for awhile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>to the drawing-room, let the lying-in room window be
thrown wide open, so as to thoroughly ventilate the
apartment, and to make it fresh and sweet on her
return. If the weather be very warm, the lower sash
of the window may for a few inches be opened. It is
wonderful how refreshing to the spirits, and how
strengthening to the frame, a well-ventilated room is
to a lying-in patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>513. Many attendants are not only unnecessary but
injurious. They excite and flurry the patient, they
cause noise and confusion, and rob the air of its purity.
One lady friend besides the doctor and the monthly
nurse is all that is needed.</p>

<p class='c008'>514. In making the selection of a friend, care should
be taken that she is the mother of a family, that she is
kind-hearted and self-possessed, and of a cheerful turn
of mind. At these times all “chatterers,” “croakers,”
and “potterers” ought to be carefully excluded from
the lying-in room. No conversation of a depressing
character should for one moment be allowed. Nurses
and friends who are in the habit of telling of bad cases
that have occurred in their experience must be avoided
as the plague. If nurses have had bad cases, many of
them have probably been of their own making; such
nurses, therefore, ought on every account to be
shunned.</p>

<p class='c008'>515. During the progress of the labor, boisterous
and noisy conversation ought never to be permitted;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>it only irritates and excites the patient. Although
boisterous merriment is bad, yet at such times quiet,
cheerful, and agreeable conversation is beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>516. A mother on these occasions is often present;
but of all persons she is the most unsuitable, as, from
her maternal anxiety, she tends rather to depress than
to cheer her daughter. Though the mother ought not
to be in the <i>room</i>, it is, if practicable, desirable that
she should be in the <i>house</i>. The patient, in the generality
of cases, derives comfort from the knowledge
of her mother being so near at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>517. Another preparation for labor is to soothe her
mind by telling her of the <i>usual</i> safety of confinements,
and by assuring her that, in the generality of instances,
it is a natural process; and that all she has to do is to
keep up her spirits, to adhere strictly to the rules of
her doctor, and she will do well.</p>

<p class='c008'>518. Tell her that “sweet is pleasure after pain;”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
tell her, too, of the exquisite happiness and joy she will
feel as soon as the labor is over, as perhaps the greatest
thrill of delight a woman ever experiences in this world
is when her babe is <i>first</i> born. She, as if by magic,
forgets all the sorrow and suffering she has endured.
“A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because
her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the
child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>that a man is born into the world.”<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> Keble, in the
<cite>Christian Year</cite>, well observes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mysterious to all thought,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A mother’s prime of bliss,</div>
      <div class='line'>When to her eager lips is brought</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her infant’s thrilling kiss.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Rogers, too, in referring to this interesting event,
sweetly sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The hour arrives, the moment wished and feared;</div>
      <div class='line'>The child is born, by many a pang endeared!</div>
      <div class='line'>And now the mother’s ear has caught his cry—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! grant the cherub to her asking eye!</div>
      <div class='line'>He comes—she clasps him; to her bosom pressed,</div>
      <div class='line'>He drinks the balm of life, and drops to rest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>519. The doctor, too, will be able to administer
comfort to her when he has “tried a pain” or has
“taken a pain,” as it is called, and when he can assure
her that it “is all right and straight”—that is to say,
that the child is presenting in the most favorable position,
and that everything is progressing satisfactorily.
He will, moreover, be able to inform her of the <i>probable</i>
duration of the labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>520. Let me in this place urge upon the patient the
importance of her allowing the medical man to inquire
fully into her state. She may depend upon it that this
inquiry will be conducted in the most delicate manner.
If there be anything wrong in the labor, it is in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span><i>early</i> stage, and <i>before</i> the “waters have broken,” that
the most good can be done. If a proper examination
be not allowed to the medical man whenever he deems
it right and proper (and a judicious doctor will do it
as seldom as he can), her life, and perhaps that of her
child, might pay the penalty of such false delicacy.</p>

<p class='c008'>521. French brandy, in case it is wanted, ought
always to be in the house; but let me impress upon
the minds of the attendants the importance of withholding
it, unless it be ordered by the doctor, from a lying-in
woman. Numbers have fallen victims to brandy
being indiscriminately given. I am of opinion that
the great caution which is now adopted in giving spirits
to women in labor is one reason, among others, of the
great safety of the confinements of the present day,
compared with those of former times.</p>

<p class='c008'>522. The best beverage for a patient during labor
is either a cup of warm tea, or of gruel, or of arrow-root.
It is folly in the extreme, during the progress of labor,
to force her to eat: her stomach recoils from it, as at
these times there is generally a loathing of food, and if
we will, as we always ought to, take the appetite as
our guide, we shall never go far wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>523. A patient during labor ought frequently to
make water; by doing so she will add materially to her
ease and comfort, and it will give the adjacent parts
more room, and will thus expedite the labor. I wish
to call attention to this point, as many ladies, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>with their first children, have, from false delicacy,
suffered severely from not attending to it; one of the
ill effects of which is inability after the labor is over to
make water without the assistance of the doctor, who
might in an extreme case deem it necessary to introduce
a catheter into the bladder, and thus to draw the
water off.</p>

<p class='c008'>524. I recommended, in a previous paragraph, that
the doctor ought to have either the drawing-room or a
bedroom to retire to, in order that the patient may,
during the progress of the labor, <i>be left very much to
herself</i>, and that thus she may have full opportunities,
whenever she feels the slightest inclination to do so, of
thoroughly emptying either her bladder or her bowels.
<i>Now, this advice is of very great importance</i>, and if it
were, more than it is, attended to, would cause a great
diminution of misery, of annoyance, and suffering. I
have given the subject great attention; as I have had
large experience in midwifery practice; I therefore
speak “like one having authority,” and if my advice
in this particular be followed, this book will not have
been written in vain.</p>

<p class='c008'>525. If the patient, twelve hours after the labor,
and having tried two or three times during that time,
is <i>unable</i> to make water, the medical man ought to be
made acquainted with it, or serious consequences might
ensue.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>CHLOROFORM IN HARD AND IN LINGERING LABOR.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>526. Mothers and doctors are indebted to Dr.—now
Sir James—Simpson for the introduction of chloroform,
one of the greatest and most valuable discoveries ever
conferred on suffering humanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>527. Sulphuric ether was formerly used to cause insensibility
to pain; but it is far inferior to chloroform,
and is now, in this country, very seldom employed;
while the inhalation of chloroform, especially in cases
of hard and of lingering labor, is every day becoming
more general, and will do so still more extensively as its
value is better understood, and when, in well-selected
cases, its comparative freedom from danger is sufficiently
appreciated.</p>

<p class='c008'>528. Chloroform, then, is a great boon in midwifery
practice; indeed, we may say with Dr. Kidd,<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> that in
labor cases “it has proved to be almost a greater boon
than in the experimental and gigantic operations of the
surgeon.” It may be administered in labor by a medical
man with perfect safety. I have given it in numerous
instances, and have always been satisfied with the
result.</p>

<p class='c008'>529. The inhalation of chloroform causes either partial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>or complete unconsciousness, and freedom from pain
either for a longer or for a shorter time, according to
the will of the operator. In other words, the effects
might with perfect safety be continued either for a few
minutes, or from time to time for several hours; indeed,
if given in proper cases, and by a judicious medical
man, with immense benefit.</p>

<p class='c008'>530. Chloroform is more applicable and useful in a
labor—more especially in a first labor—when it is
lingering, when the pains are very severe, and when,
notwithstanding the pain, it is making but little progress,—then
chloroform is a priceless boon.</p>

<p class='c008'>531. Chloroform, too, is very beneficial when the
patient is of a nervous temperament, and when she
looks forward with dread and apprehension to each
labor pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>532. It might be asked,—Would you give chloroform
in <i>every</i> case of labor, be it ever so easy and quick?
Certainly not: it is neither advisable nor expedient, in
an ordinary, easy, quick labor, to administer it.</p>

<p class='c008'>533. The cases in which it is desirable to give chloroform
are <i>all</i> lingering, hard, and severe <i>ordinary</i>
labors. In such I would gladly use it. But before
administering it, I would, as a rule, wait for at least six
hours from the commencement of the labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>534. Oh, the delightful and magical effects of it in
the cases here described! the lying-in room, from being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>in a state of gloom, despondency, and misery, is instantly
transformed, by its means, into one of cheerfulness,
hope, and happiness!</p>

<p class='c008'>535. When once a lying-in woman has experienced
the good effects of chloroform in assuaging her agony,
she importunately, at every recurrence of “the pain,”
urges her medical man to give her more! In all her
subsequent confinements, having once tasted the good
effects of chloroform, she does not dread them. I have
frequently heard a lady declare that, now (if her labor
be either hard or lingering) she can have chloroform,
she looks forward to the period of childbirth with confidence
and hope.</p>

<p class='c008'>536. It might be asked,—Does the inhalation of
chloroform retard the patient’s “getting about”? I
emphatically declare <i>that it does not do so</i>. Those who
have had chloroform have always, in my practice, had
as good and as speedy recoveries as those who have
not inhaled it.</p>

<p class='c008'>537. One important consideration in the giving of
chloroform in labor is, <i>that a patient has seldom, if
ever, while under the effects of it, been known to die</i>;
which is more than can be said when it has been administered
in surgical operations, in the extraction of
teeth, etc. “I know there is not one well-attested death
from chloroform in midwifery in all our journals.”<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>538. One reason why it may be so safe to give
chloroform in labor is, that in the practice of midwifery
a medical man does not deem it needful to put
his patient under the <i>extreme</i> influence of it. He administers
just enough to ease her pain, but not sufficient
to rob her of total consciousness; while in a surgical
operation the surgeon may consider it necessary to put
his patient under the <i>full</i> influence of chloroform:
hence the safety in the one, and the danger in the other
case. “It is quite possible to afford immense relief,
to ‘render the pains quite bearable,’ as a patient of
mine observed, by a dose which does not procure sleep
or impair the mental condition of the patient, and
which all our experience would show is absolutely free
from danger.”<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>539. There is another advantage in chloroform,—the
child, when he is born, is usually both lively and
strong, and is not at all affected by the mother having
had chloroform administered to her. This is a most
important consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>540. The doctor, too, as I before remarked, is deeply
indebted to Sir J. Simpson for this great boon: <i>formerly</i>
he dreaded a tedious and hard labor; <i>now</i> he
does not do so, as he is fully aware that chloroform
will rob such a lying-in of much of its terror and most
of its pain and suffering, and will in all probability
materially shorten the duration of the confinement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>541. Chloroform ought never to be administered,
either to a labor patient or to any one else, except by
a medical man. This advice admits of no exception.
And chloroform should never be given unless it be
either in a lingering or in a hard labor. As I have
before advised, in a natural, easy, everyday labor,
nature ought not to be interfered with, but should be
allowed to run its own course. Patience, gentleness,
and non-interference are the best and the chief requisites
required in the <i>majority</i> of labor cases.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>HINTS TO ATTENDANTS IN CASE THE DOCTOR IS UNAVOIDABLY ABSENT.</h4>

<p class='c018'>542. It frequently happens that after the <i>first</i> confinement
the labor is so rapid that the child is born
before the doctor has time to reach the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>543. It is consequently highly desirable—nay, imperatively
necessary—for the interest and for the well-doing
both of the mother and of the baby, that either
the nurse or the lady friend should, in such an emergency,
know <i>what to do and what</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>. I therefore,
in the few following paragraphs, purpose, in the
simplest and clearest language I can command, to enlighten
them on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>544. In the first place, let the attendants be both
calm and self-possessed, and let there be no noise, no
scuffling, no excitement, no whispering, and no talking,
and let the patient be made to thoroughly understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>that there is not the slightest danger; as the principal
danger will be in causing <i>unnecessary</i> fears both as to
herself and her child. Tens of thousands are annually
delivered in England, and everywhere else, without the
<i>slightest</i> assistance from a doctor,<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a>—he not being at
hand or not being in time; and yet both mother and
child almost invariably do well. Let her be informed
of this fact—for it is a fact—and it will be a comfort
to her and will assuage her fears. The medical man,
as soon as he arrives, will soon make all right and
straight.</p>

<p class='c008'>545. In the mean time let the following directions
be followed: <i>Supposing a child to be born before the
medical man arrives</i>, the nurse ought then to ascertain
whether a coil of navel-string be around the neck of
the infant; if it be, it must be instantly liberated, or he
might be strangled. Care should be taken that he has
sufficient room to breathe, that there be not a “membrane”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>over his mouth;<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> and that his face be not
buried in the clothes. Any mucus about the mouth of
the babe ought, with a soft napkin, to be wiped away,
or it might impede the breathing.</p>

<p class='c008'>546. Every infant, the moment he comes into the
world, ought to cry; if he does not naturally, he should
be made to do so by smacking his buttocks until he
does cry. He will then be safe:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“We came crying hither.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou know’st, the first time we smell the air</div>
      <div class='line'>We waul and cry.”<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>547. If the doctor has not arrived, cheerfulness, quietness,
and presence of mind must be observed by all
around; otherwise, the patient may become excited and
alarmed, and dangerous consequences might ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>548. If the infant should be <i>born apparently dead</i>, a
few smart blows must be given on the buttocks and on
the back; a smelling-bottle ought to be applied to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>nostrils, or rag should be singed under the nose, taking
care that the burning tinder does not touch the skin;
and cold water must be freely sprinkled on the face.
The navel-string, as long as there is pulsation in it,
ought not to be tied.</p>

<p class='c008'>549. The limbs, the back, and the chest of the child
ought to be well rubbed with the warm hand. The
face should not be smothered up in the clothes. If
pulsation has ceased in the navel-string (the above
rules having been strictly followed, and having failed),
let the navel-string be tied and divided,<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> and then let
the child be plunged into warm water—98° Fahr. If
the <i>sudden</i> plunge does not rouse respiration into action,
let him be taken out of the warm bath, as the keeping
him for any length of time in the water will be of no
avail.</p>

<p class='c008'>550. If these simple means should not <i>quickly</i> succeed,
although they generally will, Dr. Marshall Hall’s
<cite>Ready Method</cite> ought in the following manner to be
tried: “Place the infant on his face; turn the body
gently but completely <i>on the side and a little beyond</i>,
and then on the face, alternately; repeating these
measures deliberately, efficiently, and perseveringly,
fifteen times in the minute only.”</p>

<p class='c008'>551. Another plan of restoring suspended animation
is by artificial respiration, which should be employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>in the following manner: Let the nurse (in the absence
of the doctor) squeeze, with her left hand, the child’s
nose, to prevent any passage of air through the nostrils;
then let her apply her mouth to the child’s mouth,
and breathe into it, in order to inflate the lungs; as soon
as they are inflated, the air ought, with the right hand,
to be pressed out again, so as to imitate natural breathing.
Again and again, for several minutes, and for
about fifteen times a minute, should the above process
be repeated; and the operator will frequently be rewarded
by hearing a convulsive sob, which will be the
harbinger of renewed life.</p>

<p class='c008'>552. Until animation be restored, the navel-string,
provided there be pulsation in it, ought not to be tied.
If it be tied before the child has breathed, and before
he has cried, he will have but a <i>slight</i> chance of recovery.
While the navel-string is left entire, provided
there be still pulsation in it, the infant has the advantage
of the mother’s circulation and support.</p>

<p class='c008'>553. If Dr. Marshall Hall’s <cite>Ready Method</cite> and if
artificial respiration should not succeed, he must be
immersed up to his neck in a warm bath of 98° Fahrenheit.
A plentiful supply of warm water ought always
to be in readiness, more especially if the labor be
either hard or lingering.</p>

<p class='c008'>554. <i>Should the child have been born for some time
before the doctor has arrived</i>, it may be necessary to
tie and to divide the navel-string. The manner of performing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>it is as follows: A ligature, composed of four
or five whity-brown threads, nearly a foot in length
and with a knot at each end, ought, by a double knot,
to be <i>tightly</i> tied, at about two inches from the body of
the child, around the navel-string. A second ligature
must, in a similar manner, be applied about three inches
from the first, and the navel-string should be carefully
divided midway between the two ligatures. Of course,
if the medical man should shortly be expected, any
interference would not be advisable, as such matters
ought always to be left entirely to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>555. <i>The after birth must never be brought away by
the nurse</i>: if the doctor has not yet arrived, it should
be allowed to come away (which, if left alone in the
generality of cases, it generally will) of its own accord.
The only treatment that the nurse ought in such a case
to adopt is, that she apply, by means of her right hand,
<i>firm</i> pressure over the region of the womb: this will
have the effect of encouraging the contraction of the
womb, of throwing off the after birth, and of preventing
violent flooding.</p>

<p class='c008'>556. If the after birth does not soon come away, say
in an hour, <i>or if there be flooding</i>, another medical
man ought to be sent for; but on no account should
the nurse be allowed to interfere with it further than
by applying firm pressure over the region of the womb,
and <i>not touching the navel-string at all</i>; as I have
known dangerous, and in some cases even fatal, consequences
to ensue from such meddling.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>REST AFTER DELIVERY.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>557. A lady ought never to be disturbed for at least
an hour after the delivery; if she be, violent flooding
might be produced. The doctor, of course, will make
her comfortable by removing the soiled napkins, and
by applying clean ones in their place.</p>

<p class='c008'>558. Her head ought to be made easy; she must still
lie on her side; indeed, for the first hour let her remain
nearly in the same position as that in which she was
confined—with this only difference, that if her feet have
been pressing against the bedpost, they should be removed
from that position.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CLOTHING AFTER LABOR.</h4>

<p class='c018'>559. She ought, after the lapse of an hour or two, to
be moved from one side of the bed to the other. It
ought to be done in the most tender and cautious manner.
<i>She must not, on any account whatever, be allowed
to sit erect in the bed.</i> While being moved, she herself
should be passive—that is to say, <i>she ought to use no
exertion, no effort</i>, but should, by two attendants, be
removed from side to side; one must take hold of her
shoulders, the other of her hips.</p>

<p class='c008'>560. A patient, <i>after</i> delivery, usually feels shivering
and starved; it will therefore be necessary to throw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>additional clothing, such as a blanket or two, over her,
which ought to envelop the body, and should be well
tucked around her; but the nurse ought to be careful
not to overload her with clothes, or it might produce
flooding, fainting, etc.; as soon, therefore, as she is
warmer, let the <i>extra</i> clothing be gradually removed.
If the feet be cold, let them be wrapped in a warm
flannel petticoat, over which a pillow should be placed.</p>

<p class='c008'>561. A frequent change of linen after confinement is
desirable. Nothing is more conducive to health than
cleanliness. Great care should be taken to have the
sheets and linen well aired.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>REFRESHMENT.</h4>

<p class='c018'>562. A cup of cool, black tea, directly after a patient
is confined, ought to be given. I say cool, not cold, as
cold tea might chill her. Hot tea would be improper,
as it might induce flooding.</p>

<p class='c008'>563. As soon as she is settled in bed, there is nothing
better than a <i>small</i> basin of warm gruel.</p>

<p class='c008'>564. Brandy ought never, unless ordered by the
medical man, to be given after a confinement. Warm
beer is also objectionable; indeed, stimulants of all
kinds must, unless advised by the doctor, be carefully
avoided, as they would only produce fever, and probably
inflammation. Caudle is now seldom given; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>still, some old-fashioned people are fond of recommending
it after a labor. Caudle ought to be banished the
lying-in room; it caused in former times the death of
thousands.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>BANDAGE AFTER A CONFINEMENT.</h4>

<p class='c018'>565. (1) This consists of thick linen, similar to sheeting,
about a yard and a half long, and sufficiently broad
to comfortably support the belly. It ought to be put
on moderately tight; and should be retightened every
night and morning, or oftener, if it become slack. (2)
Salmon’s Obstetric Binder is admirably adapted to give
support after a confinement, and may be obtained of
any respectable surgical-instrument-maker.</p>

<p class='c008'>566. If there be not either a proper bandage or binder
at hand—(3) a yard and a half of <i>unbleached</i> calico,
folded double, will answer the purpose. The best pins
to fasten the bandages are the patent safety nursery-pins.
The binder requires no pins.</p>

<p class='c008'>567. A support to the belly after labor is important:
in the first place, it is a great comfort; in the second,
it induces the belly to return to its original size; and
lastly, it prevents flooding. Those ladies, more especially
if they have had large families, who have neglected
proper bandaging after their confinements, frequently
suffer from enlarged and pendulous bellies, which give
them an unwieldy and ungainly appearance.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>POSITION.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>568. <i>The way of placing the patient in bed.</i>—She
ought <i>not</i>, immediately after a labor, under any pretext
or pretense whatever, to be allowed to raise herself in
bed. If she be dressed, as recommended at paragraph
508, her soiled linen may readily be removed; and she
may be drawn up by two assistants—one being at
the shoulders and the other at the legs—to the proper
place, <i>as she herself must not be allowed to use the
slightest exertion</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>569. Inattention to the above recommendation has
caused violent flooding, fainting, bearing down of the
womb, etc., and in some cases even fatal consequences.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE LYING-IN ROOM.</h4>

<p class='c018'>570. <i>The room to be kept cool and well ventilated.</i>—A
nurse is too apt, after the confinement is over, to keep
a large fire. Nothing is more injurious than to have
the temperature of a lying-in room high. A little fire,
provided the weather be cold, to dress the baby by,
and to encourage a circulation of the air, is desirable.
A fire-guard ought to be attached to the grate of the
lying-in room. The door must occasionally be left
ajar, in order to change the air of the apartment; a
lying-in woman requires <i>pure</i> air as much as any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>person; but how frequently does the nurse fancy that
it is dangerous for her to breathe it!</p>

<p class='c008'>571. After the affair is over, the blinds ought to be
put down, and the window curtains should be drawn,
in order to induce the patient to have a sleep, and thus
to rest herself after her hard work. Perfect stillness
must reign both in the room and in the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>572. It is really surprising, in this present enlightened
age, how much misconception and prejudice there
still is among the attendants of a lying-in room; they
fancy labor to be a disease, instead of being what it
really is—<i>a natural process</i>; and that old-fashioned
notions, and not common sense, ought to guide them.</p>

<p class='c008'>573. The patient should, after the labor, be strictly
prohibited from talking; and noisy conversation ought
not to be allowed; indeed, she cannot be kept too quiet,
as she may then be induced to fall into a sweet sleep,
which would recruit her wasted strength. As soon as
the baby is washed and dressed, and the mother is made
comfortable in bed, the nurse ought alone to remain;
let every one else be banished the lying-in room. Visitors
should on no account, until the medical man gives
permission, be allowed to see the patient.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>THE BLADDER.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>574. <i>Ought a patient to go to sleep before she has
made water?</i>—There is not the least danger in her
doing so (although some old-fashioned person might
tell her that there is); nevertheless, before she goes to
sleep, if she have the slightest inclination she should
respond to it, as it would make her feel more comfortable
and sleep more sweetly.</p>

<p class='c008'>575. Let me urge the importance of the patient, <i>immediately</i>
after childbirth, making water while she is
in a lying position. I have known violent flooding to
arise from a lying-in woman being allowed, soon after
delivery, to sit up while passing her water.</p>

<p class='c008'>576. The “female slipper”<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a> (previously warmed by
dipping it in very hot water and then quickly drying
it) ought, at these times, and for some days after a
confinement, to be used. It is admirably adapted for
the purpose, as it takes up but little room and is conveniently
shaped, and readily slips under the patient,
and enables her to make water comfortably, she being
perfectly passive the while. It should be passed under
her in front, and not at the side of the body.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>577. If there be any difficulty in her making water,
the medical man must, through the nurse, be <i>immediately</i>
informed of it. False delicacy ought never to
stand in the way of this advice. It should be borne
in mind that, after either a <i>very</i> lingering or a severe
labor, there is frequently <i>retention of urine</i>,—that is to
say, that although the bladder may be full of water,
the patient is, without assistance, unable to make it.</p>

<p class='c008'>578. After the patient, while lying down, trying
several times to pass her water, and after, allowing
twelve or fifteen hours to elapse, and not being able to
do so, it will be well for her to try the following
method: Let the <i><span lang="fr">pot de chambre</span></i> be well warmed, let
the rim be covered with flannel, let her, supported the
while by the nurse, kneel <i>on</i> the bed, her shoulders
being covered with a warm shawl; then let her, with
the <i><span lang="fr">pot de chambre</span></i> properly placed between her knees
on the bed, try to make water, and the chances are
that she will <i>now</i> succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>579. If she does not, twenty-four hours having
elapsed, the doctor must be informed of the fact; and it
will then be necessary, absolutely necessary, for him,
by means of a catheter, to draw off the water. It
might be well to state that the passing of a catheter is
unattended <i>with either the slightest danger or pain</i>;
and that it is done without exposing her, and thus
without shocking her modesty.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>THE BOWELS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>580. The bowels are usually costive after a confinement.
This confined state of the bowels after labor is
doubtless a wise provision of nature, in order to give
repose to the surrounding parts—especially to the
womb; it is well, therefore, <i>not</i> to interfere with them,
but to let them have perfect rest for three days. Sometimes
before the expiration of the third day the bowels
are relieved, either without medicine or merely by the
taking of a cupful of warm coffee. If such be the case,
all well and good; as it is much better that the bowels
should be relieved <i>without</i> medicine than <i>by</i> medicine;
but if, having taken the coffee, at the end of the third
day they are not opened, then early on the following—the
fourth—morning, a dose of castor oil should be
given in the manner recommended at paragraph 281.
Either a teaspoonful or a dessertspoonful, according to
the constitution of the patient, will be a proper dose.
If, in the course of twelve hours, it should not have
the desired effect, it must be repeated. The old-fashioned
custom was to give castor oil on the morning
after the confinement; this, as I have before proved,
was a mistaken plan.</p>

<p class='c008'>581. After a lying-in, and when the bowels are not
opened either naturally or by the taking of a cupful
of warm coffee, if medicine be given by the mouth,
castor oil is the <i>best</i> medicine, as it does not irritate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>either the patient’s bowels, or, through the mother’s
milk, gripe the infant. Aperient pills, as they most of
them contain either colocynth or aloes, or both, frequently
give great pain to the babe, and purge him
much more than they do the mother herself; aperient
pills, therefore, after a confinement ought never to be
taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>582. If the patient object to the taking of castor
oil, let the nurse, by means of an enema apparatus,
administer an enema. This is an excellent, indeed the
best, method of opening the bowels, as it neither interferes
with the appetite nor with the digestion; it does
away with the nauseousness of castor oil, and does not,
in the administration, give the slightest pain. If the
first enema should not have the desired effect, let one
be given every quarter of an hour until relief be
obtained. One of the best for the purpose is the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Olive oil, two tablespoonfuls;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Table salt, two tablespoonfuls;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Warm oatmeal gruel, one pint;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a clyster.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another capital enema for the purpose is one made of
Castile soap dissolved in warm water.</p>

<p class='c008'>583. If the patient object both to the taking of the
castor oil and to the administration of an enema, then
the following draught will be found useful; it will
act kindly, and will neither gripe the mother nor the
child:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Take of—Concentrated Essence of Senna, half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Syrup of Ginger, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, seven drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a draught. To be taken early in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>If in twelve hours the above draught should not have
the desired effect (although, if the essence of senna be
good, it usually does long before that time), let the
draught be repeated. If the bowels be easily moved,
<i>half</i> of the above draught is generally sufficient; if it
be not so in twelve hours, the remainder should be
taken. But let every lying-in woman bear in mind that
as soon as her bowels will act, either naturally or by the
taking of a cupful of warm coffee, without an aperient,
not a particle of opening medicine should be taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>584. But, after all that can be said on the subject,
there is no better method in the world for opening a
lying-in patient’s bowels, when costive, than (if the
cup of coffee be not sufficiently powerful) by giving
her an enema, as advised in a previous paragraph.
An enema is safe, speedy, painless, and effectual, and
does not induce costiveness afterward, which castor
oil, and all other aperients, if repeatedly taken, most
assuredly will.</p>

<p class='c008'>585. An enema, then, is an admirable method of
opening costive bowels, both during suckling and
during pregnancy, and deserves to be more universally
followed than it now is; fortunately, the plan just
recommended is making rapid progress, and shortly
will, with ladies at such times, entirely supersede the
necessity of administering aperients by the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>586. Aperients, after a confinement, were in olden
times, as a matter of course, repeatedly given both to
the mother and to the babe, to their utter disgust and
to their serious detriment! This was only one of the
numerous mistakes and follies that formerly prevailed
in the lying-in room. Unfortunately, in those days a
confinement was looked upon as a disease, and to be
physicked accordingly. A better state of things is
happily now dawning.</p>

<p class='c008'>587. When the patient’s bowels, for the first few
days after the confinement, require to be opened, she
ought to use either the French bed-pan or the bed-pan
of the Liverpool Northern Hospital. Either the one
or the other of these pans is a great improvement on
the old-fashioned bed-pans, as they will readily slip
under the patient, and will enable her, while lying
down and while she is perfectly passive in bed, to
have her bowels relieved, which at these times is very
desirable. The French bed-pan or the bed-pan of the
Liverpool Northern Hospital is admirably adapted for
a lying-in room; indeed, no lying-in room ought to be
without either the one or the other of these useful inventions.
“A flannel cap for the toe-part, held on by
strings round the heel, will afford considerable comfort
to the patient.”<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

  <h4 class='c017'>“CLEANSINGS”—ABLUTIONS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>588. <i>The “Cleansings.”</i>—This watery discharge occurs
directly after a lying-in, and lasts either a week or
a fortnight, and sometimes even longer. It is, at first,
of a reddish color; this gradually changes to a brownish
hue, and afterward to a greenish shade; hence the
name of “green waters.” It has in some cases a disagreeable
odor. A moderate discharge is necessary;
but when it is profuse, it weakens the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>589. Some ignorant nurses object to have the parts
bathed after delivery; they have the impression that
such a proceeding would give cold. Now, warm fomentation
twice a day, and even oftener, either if the
discharge or if the state of the parts requires it, is
absolutely indispensable to health, to cleanliness, and
comfort. Ablutions, indeed, at this time are far more
necessary than at any other period of a woman’s existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>590. There is nothing better for the purpose than a
soft sponge and warm water, unless the parts be very
sore; if they be, a warm fomentation, two or three
times a day, of marshmallows and chamomile,<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a> will afford
great relief, or the parts may be bathed with warm
oatmeal gruel, of course without salt. In these cases,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>too, I have found warm barm (yeast) and water a
great comfort, and which will soon take away the soreness.
The parts ought, after each fomentation, to be
well but quickly dried with warm, dry, soft towels.</p>

<p class='c008'>591. If the <i>internal</i> parts be very sore, it may be
necessary, two or three times a day, to syringe them
out, by means of an india-rubber vaginal syringe,<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a> with
either of the above remedies. Hence the importance
of having a good monthly nurse, of having one who
thoroughly understands her business.</p>

<p class='c008'>592. Let the above rules be strictly followed. Let
no prejudices and no old-fashioned notions, either of
the nurse or of any female friend, stand in the way of
the above advice. Ablution of the parts, then, after
a confinement, and that frequently, is absolutely required,
or evil results will, as a matter of course,
ensue.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>REST AND QUIETUDE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>593. A horizontal—a level—position for either ten
days or a fortnight after a labor is important. A lady
frequently fancies that if she supports her legs, it is all
that is necessary. Now, this is absurd; it is the womb
and not the legs that requires rest; and the only way to
obtain it is by lying flat either on a bed or on a sofa:
for the first five or six days, day and night, on a bed,
and then for the next five or six days she ought to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span><i>removed</i> for a short period of the day either to another
bed or to a sofa; which other bed or sofa should be
wheeled to the side of the bed, and she must be placed
on it by two assistants, one taking hold of her shoulders
and the other of her hips, and thus lifting her on the
bed or sofa, she herself being perfectly passive, and
not being allowed to sit erect the while. She ought,
during the time she is on the sofa, to maintain the <i>level</i>
position.</p>

<p class='c008'>594. She ought, after the first nine days, to sit up
for an hour; she should gradually prolong the time of
the sitting; but still she must, for the first fortnight,
lie down a great part of every day. She should, after
the first week, lie either on a sofa or on a horse-hair
mattress.</p>

<p class='c008'>595. The above plan may appear irksome, but my
experience tells me that it is necessary, absolutely necessary.
The benefit the patient will ultimately reap
from it will amply repay the temporary annoyance of
so much rest. Where the above rules have not been
adopted, I have known flooding, bearing down of the
womb, and even “falling” of the womb, frequent miscarriages,
and ultimately ruin of the constitution, to
ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>596. “Falling of the womb” is a disagreeable complaint,
and the misfortune of it is, that every additional
child increases the infirmity. Now, all this might,
in the majority of cases, have been prevented, if the
recumbent posture for ten days or a fortnight after delivery
had been strictly adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>597. If a patient labor under a “falling of the womb,”
she ought to apply to a medical man, who will provide
her with a proper support, called a pessary, which will
prevent the womb from “falling down,” and will effectually
keep it in its proper place.</p>

<p class='c008'>598. It is only a medical man, accustomed to these
matters, who can select a pessary suitable for each individual
case. A proper kind of, and duly-adjusted,
pessary is a great comfort to a patient, and will enable
her both to take her proper exercise and to follow her
ordinary employments; indeed, if a suitable pessary be
used, it is so comfortable that the patient often forgets
that she is wearing one at all. Those pessaries ought
only to be employed that can be removed every night,
as there is not the least necessity for a patient to sleep
in one, as the womb does not usually come down when
the patient is lying down. Moreover, a pessary ought
to be kept perfectly clean, and unless it be daily removed
it is utterly impossible to keep it so. It is a great comfort
and advantage to a patient to be able both to introduce
and to remove the pessary herself, which, if a
proper kind be employed, she can, when once taught,
readily do.</p>

<p class='c008'>599. If “falling of the womb” be early and properly
treated, there is a good chance of a patient being perfectly
cured, and thus of being able to dispense with a
pessary altogether.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>DIETARY.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>600. <i>For the first day</i> the diet should consist of
nicely made and well-boiled gruel, arrow-root and milk,
bread and milk, tea, dry toast and butter, or bread and
butter; taking care not to overload the stomach with
too much fluid. Therefore, either a cupful of gruel, or
of arrow-root, or of tea, at a time, should not be exceeded,
otherwise the patient will feel oppressed; she
will be liable to violent perspiration, and there will be
a too abundant secretion of milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>601. <i>For the next—the second day.—Breakfast</i>,—either
dry toast and butter, or bread and butter, and
black tea. <i>Luncheon</i>,—either a breakfast-cupful of
strong beef-tea,<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> or of bread and milk, or of arrow-root
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>made with good fresh milk. <i>Dinner</i>,—either chicken
or game, mashed potatoes, and bread. <i>Tea</i>, the same
as for breakfast. <i>Supper</i>,—a breakfast-cupful of well-boiled
and well-made gruel, made either with water or
with fresh milk, or with water with a tablespoonful of
cream added to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>602. If beef-tea and arrow-root and milk be distasteful
to the patient, or if they do not agree, then for luncheon
let her have either a light egg pudding or a little rice
pudding instead of either the beef-tea or the arrow-root.</p>

<p class='c008'>603. <i>On the third and fourth days.</i>—Similar diet to
the <i>second day</i>, with this difference, that for her dinner
the patient should have mutton—either a mutton-chop
or a cut out of a joint of mutton, instead of the chicken
or game. The diet ought gradually to be improved, so
that at the end of four days she should return to her
usual diet, provided it be plain, wholesome, and nourishing.</p>

<p class='c008'>604. The above, <i>for the generality of cases</i>, is the
scale of dietary; but of course every lying-in woman
ought not to be treated alike. If she be weak and delicate,
she may from the beginning require good nourishment,
and instead of giving her gruel, it may, from the
<i>very commencement</i>, be necessary to prescribe good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>strong beef-tea, veal-and-milk broth,<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a> chicken-broth,
mutton-chops, grilled chicken, game, the yelk and the
white of an egg beaten up together in half a teacupful
of good fresh milk, etc. Common sense ought to guide
us in the treatment of a lying-in as of every other patient.
We cannot treat people by rule and compass;
we must be guided by circumstances; we can only lay
down general rules. There is no universal guide, then,
to be followed in the dietary of a lying-in woman; each
case may and will demand separate treatment; a delicate
woman, as I have just remarked, may, from the
very first day, require generous living; while, on the
other hand, a strong, robust, inflammatory patient may,
for the first few days, require only simple bland nourishment,
without a particle of stimulants. “And hence
the true secret of success rests in the use of <i>common
sense</i> and <i>discretion</i>—common sense to read nature
aright, and discretion in making a right use of what
the dictates of nature prescribe.”<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'>BEVERAGE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>605. <i>For the first week</i>, either toast and water, or barley-water
and milk,<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a> with the chill taken off, is the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>beverage. Wine, spirits, and beer, during this time,
unless the patient be weak and exhausted, or unless
ordered by the medical man, ought not to be given.
All liquids given during this period should be administered
by means of a feeding-cup; this plan I strongly
recommend, as it is both a comfort and a benefit to the
patient; it prevents her from sitting up in bed every
time she has to take fluids, and it keeps her perfectly
still and quiet, which, for the first week after confinement,
is very desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>606. When she is weak, and faint, and low, it may,
as early as the first or second day, be necessary to give
a stimulant, such as either a tumblerful of home-brewed
ale or a glass or two of wine daily; but, as I before
remarked, in the generality of cases, either toast and
water, or barley-water and milk, for the first week after
a confinement, is the best beverage.</p>

<p class='c008'>607. <i>After a week</i>, either a tumblerful of mild home-brewed
ale or of London or Dublin porter, where it
agrees, should be taken at dinner; but if ale or porter
be given, wine ought not to be allowed. It would be
well to keep either to ale or to porter, as may best agree
with the patient, and not to mix them, nor to take
porter at one meal and ale at another.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>608. Barreled, in this case, is superior to bottled
porter, as it contains less fixed air. On the whole,
however, I should prefer <i>home-brewed</i> ale to porter.
Either old, or very new, or very strong ale, ought not,
at this time, to be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>609. Great care is required in the summer, as the
warm weather is apt to turn the beer acid. Such beer
would not only disagree with the mother, but would
disorder the milk, and thus the infant. A nursing
mother sometimes endeavors to correct <i>sour</i> porter or
beer by putting soda in it. This plan is objectionable,
as the constant taking of soda is weakening to the
stomach and impoverishing to the blood. Moreover,
it is impossible, by any artificial expedient, to make
either <i>tart</i> beer or porter sound and wholesome, and fit
for a nursing mother. If beer or porter be sour, it is
not fit to drink, and ought either to be thrown away or
should be given to the pigs.</p>

<p class='c008'>610. Sometimes neither wine nor malt liquor agrees;
then, either new milk and water, or equal parts of fresh
milk and barley-water, will generally be found the best
beverage. If milk should also disagree, either barley-water,
or toast and water, ought to be substituted.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CHANGE OF ROOM.</h4>

<p class='c018'>611. <i>The period at which a lying-in woman should
leave her room</i> will, of course, depend upon the season,
and upon the state of her health. She may, after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>first fourteen days, usually change the chamber for the
drawing-room, provided it be close at hand; if it be not,
she ought, during the day, to remove—be either wheeled
or carried in a chair—from one bedroom to another, as
change of apartment will then be desirable. The windows,
during her absence from the room, ought to be
thrown wide open; and the bedclothes, in order that
they may be well ventilated, should be thrown back.
She should, at the end of three weeks, take her meals
with the family; but even then she ought occasionally,
during the day, to lie on the sofa to rest her back.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR.</h4>

<p class='c018'>612. The period at which a lady, after her confinement,
ought to take exercise in the <i>open</i> air, will, of
course, depend upon the season, and upon the state of
the wind and weather. In the <i>winter</i>, not until the
expiration of a month, and not even then unless the
weather be fine for the season. Carriage exercise will
at first be the most suitable. In the <i>summer</i> she may,
at the end of three weeks, take an airing in a carriage,
provided the weather be fine, and the wind be neither
in an easterly nor in a northeasterly direction. At the
expiration of the month she may, provided the season
and weather will allow, go out of doors regularly, and
gradually resume her household duties and employments.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>PART IV.<br> <span class='c016'>SUCKLING.</span></h3>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'>THE DUTIES OF A NURSING MOTHER</h4>

<p class='c018'>613. A mother ought not, unless she intend to devote
herself to her baby, to undertake to suckle him.
She must make up her mind to forego the so-called
pleasures of fashionable life. There ought, in a case of
this kind, to be no half-and-half measures; she should
either give up her helpless babe to the tender mercies
of a wet-nurse, or she must devote her whole time and
energy to his welfare—to the greatest treasure that God
hath given her.</p>

<p class='c008'>614. If a mother be blessed with health and strength,
it is most unnatural and very cruel for her not to suckle
her child—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Connubial fair! whom no fond transport warms</div>

      <div class='line'>His tender wailings with unfeeling ear;</div>
      <div class='line'>The soothing kiss and milky rill deny</div>
      <div class='line'>To the sweet pouting lip and glistening eye!</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! what avails the cradle’s damask roof,</div>
      <div class='line'>The eider bolster, and embroidered woof!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Oft hears the gilded couch unpitied plains,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a tear the tasseled cushion stains!</div>
      <div class='line'>No voice so sweet attunes his cares to rest,</div>

      <div class='line'>The cherub Innocence, with smile divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shuts his white wings, and sleeps on beauty’s shrine.”<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>615. Oh, if a mother did but know the joy that
suckling her infant imparts, she would never for one
moment contemplate having a wet-nurse to rob her of
that joy—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The starting beverage meets the thirsty lip;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis joy to yield it, and ’tis joy to sip.”<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>616. Lamentable, indeed, must it be, if any unavoidable
obstacle should prevent a mother from nursing her
own child!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE BREAST.</h4>

<p class='c018'>617. As soon as the patient has recovered from the
fatigue of the labor—that is to say, in about four or six
hours—attention ought to be paid, more especially in a
<i>first</i> confinement, to the bosoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>618. In a <i>first</i> confinement, there is, until the third
day, but very little milk; although there is usually on
that day, and for two or three days afterward, a great
deal of swelling, of hardness, of distention, and of uneasiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>of the breasts, in consequence of which, in a
<i>first</i> confinement, both care and attention are needed.</p>

<p class='c008'>619. If there be milk in the breast, which may be
readily ascertained by squeezing the nipple between
the finger and the thumb, the infant should, at <i>first</i>, be
applied—not <i>frequently</i>, as some do, but at considerable
intervals, say until the milk be properly secreted—every
four hours; when the milk flows, the child ought
to be applied more frequently, but still at stated times.</p>

<p class='c008'>620. To wash away any viscid mucus from the nipple,
or any stale perspiration from the bosom, let the breasts
and the nipples, before applying the baby, be first
sponged with a little warm water, and then be dried
with a warm, dry, soft napkin; for some infants are so
particular that unless the breasts and the nipples be
perfectly free from mucus and from perspiration, they
will not suck. If after the above cleansing process
there be any difficulty in making him take the bosom,
smear a little cream on the nipple, and then immediately
apply him to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>621. If the breasts be full, hard, knotty, and painful,
which they generally are two or three days after a <i>first</i>
confinement, let them be well but tenderly rubbed every
four hours, either with the best olive oil (a little of which
should, before using it, be previously warmed, by putting
a little of the oil in a teacup on the hob by the fire) or
with equal parts of olive oil and of <i>eau de Cologne</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>which should be well shaken up in a bottle every time
before it be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>622. On the third day, more especially after a <i>first</i>
confinement, the breasts are apt to become very much
swollen, painful, and distended. If such be the case,
it might be necessary, for a few days, to have them
drawn, once or twice daily, by a woman who makes it
her business, and who is usually called either a breast-drawer,
or, in vulgar parlance, a suck-pap. A clean,
sober, healthy, respectable woman ought to be selected.
There is, in nearly every large town, one generally to
be found who is at the head of her profession. Such
a one should be chosen.</p>

<p class='c008'>623. If the bosoms be more than usually large and
painful, in addition to assiduously using the above liniment,
apply to the breasts, in the intervals, young cabbage-leaves,
which should be renewed after each rubbing.
Before applying them, the “veins” of the leaves,
with a sharp knife, must be cut smooth, level with the
leaf. It will require several, as the whole of the breast
ought to be covered. The cabbage-leaves will be found
both cooling and comfortable. Each bosom should then
be nicely supported with a soft folded silk handkerchief,
going under each breast and suspending it; each handkerchief
should then be tied at the back of the neck,
thus acting as a kind of sling.</p>

<p class='c008'>624. The patient ought not, while the breasts are
full and uncomfortable, to drink <i>much</i> fluid, as it would
only encourage a larger secretion of milk.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>625. When the milk is at “its height,” as it is called,
she ought every morning, for a couple of mornings, to
take a little cooling medicine—a Seidlitz powder—and,
every four hours, the following effervescing mixture:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Bicarbonate of Potash, one drachm and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, eight ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a mixture. Two tablespoonfuls to be taken, with two
tablespoonfuls of the Acid Mixture, every four hours, while
effervescing.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Citric Acid, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, eight ounces:</div>
      <div class='line'>Mix.—The Acid Mixture.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The best way of taking the above effervescing medicine
is to put two tablespoonfuls of the first mixture
into a tumbler, and two tablespoonfuls of the acid mixture
into a wineglass, then to add the latter to the
former, and it will bubble up like soda-water; she should
<i>instantly</i> drink it off while effervescing.</p>

<p class='c008'>626. In two or three days, under the above management,
the size of the bosoms will decrease, all pain will
cease, and the infant will take the breast with ease and
comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>627. <i>Second and succeeding confinements.</i>—If the
breasts are tolerably comfortable (which in the second
and in succeeding confinements they probably will be),
let nothing be done to them except, as soon as the milk
comes, at regular intervals applying the child alternately
to each of them. Many a bosom has been made
uncomfortable, irritable, swollen, and even sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>gathered, by the nurse’s interference and meddling.
Meddlesome midwifery is bad, and I am quite sure that
meddlesome breast-tending is equally so. A nurse, in
her wisdom, fancies that by rubbing, by pressing, by
squeezing, by fingering, by liniment, and by drawing,
she does great good, while in reality, in the majority
of cases, by such interference she does great harm.</p>

<p class='c008'>628. The child will, in <i>second</i> and in <i>succeeding</i> confinements,
as a rule, be the best and the only doctor the
bosoms require. I am quite convinced that, in a general
way, nurses interfere too much, and that the bosoms in
consequence suffer. It is, of course, the doctor’s and not
the nurse’s province in such matters, to direct the treatment;
while it is the nurse’s duty to fully carry out the
doctor’s instructions.</p>

<p class='c008'>629. There is nothing, in my opinion, that so truly
tells whether a nurse be a <i>good</i> one or otherwise, as
the way she manages the breasts; a <i>good</i> nurse is judicious,
and obeys the medical man’s orders to the very
letter; while, on the other hand, a <i>bad</i> nurse acts on
her own judgment, and is always quacking, interfering,
and fussing with the breasts, and doing on the sly what
she dare not do openly: such conceited, meddlesome
nurses are to be studiously avoided; they often cause,
from their meddlesome ways, the breasts to gather.</p>

<p class='c008'>630. Let the above advice be borne in mind, and
much trouble, misery, and annoyance might be averted.
Nature, in the majority of cases, manages these things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>much better than any nurse possibly can do, and does
not, as a rule, require helping. The breasts are sadly
too much interfered and messed with by nurses, and by
nurses who are, in other respects, tolerably good ones.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>STATED TIMES FOR SUCKLING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>631. A mother ought to suckle her baby at stated
times. It is a bad habit to give him the bosom every
time he cries, regardless of the cause; for be it what it
may—over-feeding, griping, “wind,” or acidity—she is
apt to consider the breast a panacea for all his sufferings.
“A mother generally suckles her infant too often—having
him almost constantly at the bosom. This
practice is injurious both to parent and to child. For
the first month he should be suckled about every hour
and a half; for the second month, every two hours;
gradually, as he becomes older, increasing the distance
of time between, until at length he has the breast about
every four hours. If he were suckled at stated periods
he would only look for it at those times, and be satisfied.”<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>632. A mother frequently allows her babe to be at
the bosom a great part of every night. Now, this plan
is hurtful both to her and to him; it weakens her, and
thus enfeebles him; it robs them both of their sleep;
and generates bad habits, which it will be difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>break through; it often gives the mother a sore nipple
and the child a sore mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>633. It is surprising how soon an infant, at a very
early age, may, by judicious management, be brought
into good habits; it only requires, at first, a little
determination and perseverance: therefore a nursing
mother ought at once to commence by giving the child
the breast at stated periods, and she should rigidly
adhere to the times above recommended.</p>

<p class='c008'>634. A mother should not, <i>directly</i> after taking a
long walk, and while her skin is in a state of <i>violent</i>
perspiration, give her baby the bosom; the milk being
at that time in a heated state, will disorder the child’s
bowels, or it may originate in him some skin disease,
and one which it might be difficult to cure. She ought,
therefore, before she gives him the breast, to wait until
the surface of her body be <i>moderately</i> cool. Let her
be careful the while not to sit in draughts.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CLOTHING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>635. A nursing mother ought to have her dress, more
especially her stays, made loose and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>636. A gathered breast sometimes arises from the
bones of the stays pressing into the bosom; I should,
therefore, recommend her to have the bones removed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>637. If a lady be not in the habit of wearing a flannel
waistcoat, she ought at least to have her bosoms
covered with flannel, taking care that there be a piece
of soft linen over the nipples.</p>

<p class='c008'>638. I should advise a nursing mother to provide
herself with a waterproof nursing apron, which may
be procured either at any baby-linen establishment or
at an india-rubber warehouse.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DIETARY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>639. A nursing mother ought to live plainly; her
diet should be both light and nourishing. It is a mistaken
notion that at these times she requires <i>extra</i>
good living. She ought never to be forced to eat more
than her appetite demands; if she be, either indigestion,
or heartburn, or sickness, or costiveness, or a
bowel complaint will ensue. It is a folly at any time
to force the appetite. If she be not hungry, compelling
her to eat will do her more harm than good. A
medical man, in such a case, ought to be consulted.</p>

<p class='c008'>640. The best meats are mutton and beef; veal and
pork may, for a change, be eaten. <i>Salted</i> meats are
hard of digestion; if boiled beef, therefore, be eaten,
it ought to be only <i>slightly</i> salted. It is better, in
winter, to have the boiled beef <i>unsalted</i>; it is then,
especially if it be the rump, deliciously tender. Salt, of
course, must be eaten with the <i>unsalted</i> meat. High-seasoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>dishes are injurious; they inflame the blood,
and thus they disorder the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>641. Some persons consider that there is no care required
in the selection of the food, and that a nursing
mother may eat anything, be it ever so gross and unwholesome;
but, if we appeal to reason and to facts,
we shall be borne out in saying that great care is required.
It is well known that cow’s milk very much
partakes of the properties of the food on which the
animal lives. Thus, if a cow feed on swedes, the milk
and the butter will have a turnipy flavor. This, beyond
a doubt, decides that the milk does partake of
the qualities of the food on which she feeds. The same
reasoning holds good in the human species, and proves
the absurdity of a nursing mother being allowed to eat
anything, be it ever so gross, indigestible, or unwholesome.
Again, either a dose of purgative medicine given
to her, or greens taken by her at dinner, will sometimes
purge the baby as violently, or even more so, than it
will herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>642. Even the milk of a healthy wet-nurse acts differently,
and less beneficially, upon the child than the
mother’s <i>own</i> milk. The ages of the mother and of
the wet-nurse, the ages of her own and the latter’s
infant, the constitutions of the one and of the other,
the adaptability of a mother’s milk for her <i>own</i> particular
child—all tend to make a foster-mother not
so desirable a nurse as the mother herself. Again, a
mother cannot at all times get to the antecedents of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>wet-nurse; and, if she can, they will not always bear
investigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>643. With regard to the ages of the mother and of
the wet-nurse—for instance, as a wet-nurse’s milk is
generally a few weeks older than the mother’s own
milk, the wet-nurse’s milk may, and frequently does,
produce costiveness of the bowels of her foster-child;
while, on the other hand, the mother’s own milk, being
in age just adapted to her babe’s, may and generally
does keep her own infant’s bowels regular. The milk,
according to the age of the child, alters in properties
and qualities to suit the age, constitution, and acquirements
of her baby—adapting itself, so to speak, to his
progressive development. Hence the importance of a
mother, if possible, suckling her own child.</p>

<p class='c008'>644. A babe who is suckled by a mother who lives
grossly is more prone to disease, particularly to skin
and to inflammatory complaints, and to disease which
is more difficult to subdue.</p>

<p class='c008'>645. Do not let me be misunderstood: I am not
advocating that a mother should be fussily particular—by
no means. Let her take a variety of food, both
animal and vegetable; let her from day to day vary her
diet; let her ring the changes on boiled and stewed, on
grilled and roast meats; on mutton and lamb and
beef; on chicken and game and fish; on vegetables,
potatoes, and turnips; on broccoli and cauliflower, on
asparagus and peas (provided they are young and well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>boiled), and French beans. “The maxim of the greatest
importance in reference to the materials of human
food is, mixture and variety—a maxim founded, as has
been stated, upon man’s omnivorous nature. Animal
and vegetable substances, soups and solid meat, fish,
flesh, and fowl, in combination or succession, ought, if
due advantage is to be taken of the health-sustaining
element in food, to form the dietary of every household.”<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>646. But what I object to a nursing mother taking
are—gross meats, such as goose and duck; highly-salted
beef; shell-fish, such as lobster and crab; rich
dishes; <i>highly-seasoned</i> soup; pastry, unless it be
plain; and cabbages and greens and pickles, if found
to disagree with the baby; and any other article of
food which is either rich, or gross, or indigestible,
and which, from experience, she has found to disagree
either with herself or with her child. It will be seen,
therefore, from the above catalogue, that my restrictions
as to diet are limited, and are, I hope, founded
both on reason and on common sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>647. A moderate quantity—say a tumblerful—either
of fresh <i>mild</i> ale or of porter will generally be found
the best beverage both for dinner and for supper. There
is much more nourishment in either ale—home-brewed—or
in porter, than in wine; therefore, for a nursing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>mother, either ale or porter is far preferable to wine.
Wine, if taken at all, ought to be used very sparingly,
and then not at the same meal with the porter or ale.
In the higher ranks of life, where a lady is in the
habit of drinking wine, it is necessary to continue it,
although the quantity should not be increased, and
ought never to exceed a couple of glasses—dry sherry
being the best wine for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>648. A nursing mother is subject to thirst. When
such be the case, she ought not to fly either to beer or
to wine to quench it; this will only add fuel to the fire.
The best beverages will be either toast and water, milk
and water, barley-water, barley-water and new milk (in
equal proportions), or black tea, either hot or cold.
Cold black tea is a good quencher of thirst.</p>

<p class='c008'>649. A lady who is nursing is at times liable to fits
of depression. Let me strongly urge the importance of
her abstaining from wine and from all other stimulants
as a remedy; they would only raise for a time her
spirits, and then would depress them in an increased
ratio. Either a drive in the country, or a short walk,
or a cup of tea, or a chat with a friend, would be the
best medicine. The diet should be good and nourishing;
plenty of bread and plenty of meat should be her
staple food, in addition to which Du Barry’s <cite>Arabica
Revalenta</cite>, made either with fresh milk or with cream
and water, is, in these cases, most useful and sustaining.
The best time for taking it is either for luncheon
or for supper. A lady subject to depression should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>bear in mind that she requires nourishment, not stimulants,—that
much wine and spirits might cheer her for
the moment, but will assuredly depress her afterward.
Depression always follows overstimulation; wine and
spirits therefore, in such a case, if taken largely, are
false and hollow friends. It is necessary to bear the
above facts in mind, as there are many advocates who
strongly recommend, in a case of this kind, a large
consumption of wine and brandy. Such men are, at
the present moment, doing an immense deal of mischief;
they are, in point of fact, inducing and encouraging
drunkenness.</p>

<p class='c008'>650. Spirits—brandy, rum, gin, and whisky—are,
during suckling, injurious; I may even say that they
are insidious poisons to the parent, and, indirectly, to
the child.</p>

<p class='c008'>651. When an infant is laboring under an inflammatory
complaint, a nursing mother ought not to take
stimulants, such as either ale or wine. In a case of
this kind, toast and water will, for her dinner, be the
best beverage, gruel for her supper, and black tea—not
coffee, as it would be too stimulating—both for her
breakfast and tea.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>FRESH AIR AND EXERCISE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>652. Out-door exercise during suckling cannot be too
strongly insisted upon; it is the finest medicine both
for babe and mother. Whenever the weather will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>admit, it must be taken. It is utterly impossible for a
nursing mother to make good milk, unless she do take
an abundance of exercise and breathe plenty of fresh
air.</p>

<p class='c008'>653. Whatever improves the health of the mother,
of course at the same time benefits the child: there is
nothing more conducive to health than an abundance of
out-door exercise. It often happens that a mother who
is nursing seldom leaves her house; she is a regular
fixture; the consequence is, both she and her babe are
usually delicate and prone to sickness.</p>

<p class='c008'>654. A mother ought not, <i>immediately</i> after taking
exercise, to nurse her infant, but wait for half an hour.
Nor should she take <i>violent</i> exercise, as it would be
likely to disorder the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>655. Carriage exercise, if the weather be hot and
sultry, is preferable to walking; if that be not practicable,
she ought to have the windows thrown wide
open, and should walk about the hall, the landings, and
the rooms, as she would by such means avoid the intense
heat of the sun. Although carriage exercise
during intensely hot weather is preferable to walking
exercise, yet, notwithstanding, walking must, during
some portion of the day, be practiced. There is no
substitute, as far as health is concerned, for walking.
Many ailments that ladies now labor under could be
walked away; and really it would be a pleasant physic—far
more agreeable than pills and potions!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>THE POSITION OF A MOTHER DURING SUCKLING.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>656. Good habits are as easily formed as bad ones.
A mother, when in bed, ought always to suckle her
child while she is lying down. The sitting up in bed,
during such times, is a fruitful source of inflammation
and of gathering of the breasts. Of course, during the
day the sitting-up position is the best. Let me caution
her not to nurse her baby in a half-sitting and half-lying
posture; it will spoil her figure, disturb her repose,
and weaken her back.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE TEMPER.</h4>

<p class='c018'>657. Passion is injurious to the mother’s milk, and
consequently to the child. Sudden joy and grief frequently
disorder the infant’s bowels, producing griping,
looseness, etc.; hence, a mother who has a mild, placid
temper generally makes an excellent nurse, on which
account it is a fortunate circumstance that she is frequently
better-tempered during suckling than at any
other period of her life; indeed, she usually, at such
times, experiences great joy and gladness.</p>

<p class='c008'>658. The happiest period of a woman’s existence is,
as a rule, when she first becomes a mother. “The
pleasure of the young mother in her babe is said to be
more exquisite than any other earthly bliss.”<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>659. It is an old and, I believe, a true saying, that
the child inherits the temper of his mother or of his
wet-nurse. This may be owing to the following
reasons: If the mother or the wet-nurse be good-tempered,
the milk will be more likely to be wholesome,
which will, of course, make him more healthy, and consequently
better-tempered.</p>

<p class='c008'>660. While, on the other hand, if the mother or the
nurse be of an irritable, cross temper, the milk will
suffer, and will thus cause disarrangement to his system;
and hence ill health and ill temper will be likely
to ensue. We all know the influence that good or bad
health has on the temper.</p>

<p class='c008'>661. An important reason, then, why a nursing
mother is often better-tempered than she is at other
times is, she is in better health, her stomach is in a
healthier state:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A good digestion turneth all to health.”<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c014'><sup>[116]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>There is an old and a true saying, “that it is the
stomach that makes the man,” and if the man, the
woman:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your stomach makes your fabric roll,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just as the bias rules the bowl.”<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>662. Hear what Shakspeare says of the functions of
the stomach. The stomach is supposed to speak (and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>does it not frequently speak, and in very unmistakable
language, if we will but only listen to its voice?):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Coriolanus</i>, act i. sc. 1.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>OCCUPATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>663. I strongly recommend a nursing mother to
attend to her household duties. She is never so happy,
nor so well, as when her mind is moderately occupied
at something useful. She never looks so charming as
when she is attending to her household duties—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“For nothing lovelier can be found</div>
      <div class='line'>In woman, than to study household good.”<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>664. I do not mean by occupation the frequenting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of balls, of routs, or of parties: a nursing mother has
no business to be at such places; she ought to devote
herself to her infant and to her household, and she will
then experience the greatest happiness this world can
afford.</p>

<p class='c008'>665. One reason why the poor make so much better
nursing mothers than the rich is the former having so
much occupation; while the latter, having no real work
to do, the health becomes injured, and in consequence
the functions of the breasts suffer; indeed, many a
fashionable lady has no milk at all, and is therefore
compelled to delegate to a wet-nurse one of her greatest
privileges and enjoyments.</p>

<p class='c008'>666. What would not some rich mother give for the
splendid supply of milk—of healthy, nourishing, life-giving
milk—of the poor woman who has to labor for
her daily bread!</p>

<p class='c008'>667. What is the reason that wealthy ladies so frequently
require wet-nurses? The want of occupation!
And from whom do they obtain the supply of wet-nurses?
From the poor women who have no lack of
occupation, as they have to labor for their daily food,
and have in consequence the riches of health, though
poor in this world’s goods—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For health is riches to the poor.”<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Bear this in mind, ye wealthy, and indolent, and pampered
ladies, and alter your plans of life, or take the
consequences, and still let the poor women have the
healthy, the chubby, the rosy, the laughing children;
and you, ye rich ones, have the unhealthy, the skinny,
the sallow, the dismal little old men and women who
are constantly under the doctor’s care, and who have
to struggle for their very existence! “Employment,
which Galen calls ‘nature’s physician,’ is so essential
to human happiness, that Indolence is justly considered
as the mother of Misery.”<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>668. Occupation, then—bustling occupation, real
downright work, either in the form of out-door exercise,
or of attending to her household duties—a lady, if she
desire to have a good breast of milk, ought to take; if,
in point of fact, she wishes to have healthy children.
For the Almighty is no respecter of persons. And he
has ordained that work shall be the lot of man and of
woman too! It is a blessed thing to be obliged to
work. If we do not work, we have all to pay a heavy
penalty, in the form of loss of both health and happiness.
“For work is the grand cure of all the maladies
and miseries that ever beset mankind—honest work,
which you intend getting done.”<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>669. A mother who is listless and idle, lolling either
the greater part of every day in an easy-chair, or reclining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>on a sofa in a room where a breath of air is
not allowed to enter, usually makes a miserable and
a wretched nurse. She is nervous, dyspeptic, and emaciated;
having but little milk, and that little of a bad
quality, her baby is puny, pallid, and unhealthy, and
frequently drops into an untimely grave. Occupation,
then, with fresh air and exercise, is indispensable to a
mother who is suckling.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>AILMENTS, Etc.</h4>

<p class='c018'>670. <i>The Nipple.</i>—A <i>good</i> nipple is important both
to the comfort of the mother and to the well-doing of
the child.</p>

<p class='c008'>671. One, among many, of the ill effects of stays and
of corsets is the <i>pushing-in of the nipples</i>; sore nipples,
and consequent suffering, are the result. Moreover,
a mother thus circumstanced may be quite unable
to suckle her infant; and then she will be severely
punished for her ignorance and folly; she will be compelled
to forego the pleasure of nursing her own children,
and she will be obliged to delegate to hirelings
her greatest privilege! Ladies who never wear stays
have much better nipples, and more fully-developed
bosoms; hence such mothers are more likely to make
better nurses to their babies. There is no doubt that
the pressure of the stays on the bosom tends both to
waste away the gland of the breast (where the milk is
secreted), and to cause the nipple either to dwindle or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>to be pushed in, and thus to sadly interfere with its
functions. I should strongly advise every mother who
has daughters old enough to profit by it, to bear this
fact in mind, and thus to prevent mischief when mischief
might be prevented, by not allowing them, when
young, to wear stays.</p>

<p class='c008'>672. <i>Treatment of very small and drawn-in nipples.</i>—The
baby ought to suck through the intervention
of an india-rubber teat fastened on a boxwood
shield, or through an india-rubber teat and shield,
made entirely of india-rubber.<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The india-rubber teat
must, before it is used, be softened by dipping it in
warm but not in hot water. I have known many
mothers able to suckle their children with this contrivance
who otherwise would have been obliged either
to have weaned them, or to have procured the assistance
of a wet-nurse. The above aid, in the generality
of instances, will enable the infant to suck with ease.
After this has for a time been used, the nipples will
be so improved as to render the continuance of it unnecessary.
Of course I do not advise the use of an
india-rubber teat until a fair trial has been given by
applying the babe at <i>once</i> to the nipple; but if he cannot
draw out the nipple, then, rather than wean him, or
than employ a wet-nurse, let the teat be tried.</p>

<p class='c008'>673. Remember, as soon as the nipple be sufficiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>drawn out, which in all probability it will in a few
days, the teat ought to be dispensed with. In such a
case, when the infant is not at the breast, Dr. Wansbrough’s
Metallic Nipple Shields should be worn.
Small and bad nipples have, by the wearing of these
shields, frequently been drawn out and made good
ones; the dress will suffice to keep them in their places.</p>

<p class='c008'>674. <i>Sore nipples.</i>—If a lady, during the latter few
months of her pregnancy, were to adopt the plan recommended
at page <a href='#Page_162'>162</a>, paragraph 353, sore nipples, during
the period of suckling, would not be so prevalent as
they now are.</p>

<p class='c008'>675. A sore nipple is frequently produced by the
injudicious custom of allowing the child to have the
nipple almost constantly in his mouth. Stated periods
for suckling, as recommended at paragraph 631, ought
to be strictly adopted. Another frequent cause of a
sore nipple is from the babe having the thrush. It is
a folly to attempt to cure the nipple without at the
same time curing the mouth of the infant.</p>

<p class='c008'>676. <i>Treatment.</i>—One of the best remedies for a
sore nipple is the following powder:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Biborate of Soda, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Powdered Starch, seven drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix,—A pinch of the powder to be frequently applied to
the nipple.</p>

<p class='c008'>677. Dr. A. Todd Thomson’s—my old preceptor—remedy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>for sore nipple is a very good one; it is as
follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Finely-powdered Gum Arabic, half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Powdered Alum, five grains:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>To be well mixed together in a mortar to make a powder, of
which a pinch should either be sprinkled over the nipple, or
it may be applied to the part by means of a camel’s-hair
brush every time directly after the child has done sucking.
Let the brush, covered with the dry powder, gently sweep
over the sore nipple.</p>

<p class='c008'>As there is nothing in either of the above powders injurious
to the infant, the powder, before applying him
to the breast, ought not to be wiped off; indeed, either
the one or the other of the powders (the former one
especially, as it contains borax) is likely to be of service
in preventing or in curing the sore mouth of the
child.</p>

<p class='c008'>678. If the above powders should not have the desired
effect (efficacious though they usually are), “a
liniment composed of equal parts of glycerin and of
brandy” (say a vial containing two drachms of each)
ought to be tried, which must be shaken up just before
using. It should, by means of a camel’s-hair brush,
every time directly after the baby has been suckled, be
painted on the nipple. A piece of either old soft cambric
or lawn, about the size of the palm of the hand,
snipped around to make it fit, ought then to be moistened
in the glycerin and the brandy, and should be
applied to each of the sore nipples, and worn (until they
are cured) whenever the child is not at the breast.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>These applications will be found of much service and
of great comfort, and will act as nipple shields, protecting
and healing the nipples. A soft sponge of warm
water may be gently applied to the nipple just before
putting the child to the bosom.</p>

<p class='c008'>679. If the above remedies should not succeed in
curing the sore nipple, then she ought to try Dr. Wansbrough’s
Metallic Nipple Shield (as recommended previously
for small and drawn-in nipples), and should,
whenever the babe is not sucking, constantly wear it
on the nipple. It is very cooling and healing, and keeps
off all pressure from the clothes. It will frequently
cure a sore nipple when other remedies have failed.
The shield may be procured of any respectable surgical-instrument-maker.</p>

<p class='c008'>680. <i>Cracked and fissured nipples.</i>—Sometimes the
nipple is sore from having either cracks or fissures upon
it. These cracks or fissures may attack any part of the
nipple, but are very apt to form where the nipple joins
the breast; and, when very severe, an ignorant nurse,
who is always fond of dealing in the marvelous, declares
that the child has nearly bitten the nipple off! <i>Treatment.</i>—Now,
the best remedy for a <i>cracked</i> and <i>fissured</i>
nipple is for the infant, until the cracks and
fissures are cured, to suck through the intervention
of an india-rubber teat and shield; and every time,
directly after the babe has been put to the nipple, to
apply to the parts affected either neat brandy or the
glycerin and brandy liniment, as I have before recommended.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>When the child is not at the breast, Dr.
Wansbrough’s Nipple Shields should be worn; the
dress will keep them in their places.</p>

<p class='c008'>681. Another cause of a sore nipple is from the
mother, after the babe has been sucking, putting up
the nipple wet. She, therefore, <i>ought always to dry the
nipple</i>—not by rubbing it, but by dabbing it with either
a soft cambric or lawn handkerchief, or with a piece of
soft linen rag (one or other of which ought always to
be at hand), every time directly after the infant has
done sucking, and just before applying either of the
above powders or liniment to the nipple.</p>

<p class='c008'>682. When the nipple is very sore, a mother, whenever
the child is put to the bosom, suffers intense pain.
This being the case, she had better suckle him through
the intervention of an india-rubber teat, properly fastened
on a shield, as before recommended. See page
<a href='#Page_276'>276</a>, paragraph 672. But she ought never to use an
india-rubber teat unless it be absolutely necessary—that
is to say, if the nipple be only <i>slightly</i> sore, she
should not, on any account, apply it; but there are
cases where the nipple is so <i>very</i> sore that a mother
would have to give up nursing if the shield and teat
were not used; these, and very small and drawn-in-nipples,
are the only cases in which an india-rubber
teat and shield is admissible.</p>

<p class='c008'>683. A nursing mother is sometimes annoyed by the
milk <i>flowing constantly away</i>, making her wet and uncomfortable.
All she can do under such circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>is to wear nipple-glasses, and to apply a piece of flannel
to the bosom, which will prevent the milk from
chilling her, and will thus do away with the danger of
her catching cold, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>684. <i>The breast.</i>—A mother ought, before applying
the infant to the bosom, to carefully ascertain if there
be milk. This may readily be done by squeezing the
nipple between the finger and the thumb. If there
be <i>no</i> milk, she must wait until the milk be secreted,
or serious consequences both to her and to him might
ensue: to the former, inflammation and gathering of
the bosom, and sore nipples; to the latter, thrush, diarrhœa,
and eruptions on the skin.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>685. If there be a supply of milk in the breast, and
if still the child will not suck, the medical man’s attention
ought to be drawn to the fact, in order that he
may ascertain whether the child be tongue-tied; if he
be, the mystery is explained, and a trifling, painless
operation will soon make all right.</p>

<p class='c008'>686. If the <i>bosoms be full and uneasy</i>, they ought,
three or four times a day, to be well although tenderly
rubbed with olive oil and <i>eau de Cologne</i> (equal parts
of each, mixed in a vial). Some nurses rub with their
fingers only. Now, such rubbing does harm. The
proper way to apply friction is to pour a small quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>of the oil and <i>eau de Cologne</i>—first shaking the
bottle—into the palm of the hand, the hand being
warm, and then to well rub the breasts, taking care to
use the whole of the inside of the hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>687. After the bosoms have been well rubbed, each
ought to be nicely supported with a large, soft, folded
silk handkerchief; each handkerchief must pass <i>under</i>
each breast and <i>over</i> the shoulders, and should be tied
at the back of the neck, thus acting as a sling.</p>

<p class='c008'>688. If the bosoms be very uncomfortable, young
cabbage-leaves (with the “veins” of each leaf cut level
to the leaf) ought, after each application of the oil and
<i>eau de Cologne</i>, to be applied; or a large warm white-bread-and-milk
and olive oil poultice ought to be used,
which must be renewed three or four times a day. The
way to make the poultice is as follows: A thick round
of bread should be cut from a white loaf; the crust
should be removed, the crumb ought to be cut into
pieces about an inch square, upon which boiling-hot
new milk should be poured; it ought to be covered
over for ten minutes; then the milk should be drained
off, and the olive oil—previously warmed by placing a
little in a teacup on the hob—should be beaten up by
means of a fork with the moistened bread until it be
of the consistence of a soft poultice. It ought to be
applied to the bosom as hot as it can comfortably be
borne.</p>

<p class='c008'>689. <i>Gathered breast.</i>—A gathered bosom, or “bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>breast” as it is sometimes called, is more likely to
occur after a <i>first</i> confinement and during the <i>first</i>
month. Great care, therefore, ought to be taken to
avoid such a misfortune. A gathered breast is frequently
owing to the carelessness of a mother in not
covering her bosoms during the time she is suckling.
Too much attention cannot be paid to keeping the
breasts <i>comfortably</i> warm. This, during the act of
nursing, should be done by throwing either a shawl
or a square of flannel over the neck, shoulders, and
bosoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>690. Another cause of a gathered breast arises from
a mother sitting up in bed to suckle her baby. An
infant ought to be accustomed to take the bosom while
he is lying down; if this habit be not at first instituted,
it will be difficult to adopt it afterward. Good habits
may be taught a child from the very earliest period of
his existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>691. A sore nipple is another fruitful cause of a
gathered breast. A mother, in consequence of the suffering
it produces, dreads putting the baby to it; she
therefore keeps him almost entirely to the other bosom.
The result is, the breast with the sore nipple becomes
distended with milk, which, being unrelieved, ends in
inflammation, and subsequently in gathering.</p>

<p class='c008'>692. The <i>fruitless</i> attempt of an infant, to procure
milk when there is very little or none secreted is another
and a frequent cause of a gathered bosom. Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Ballard, in his valuable little work before quoted, considers
this to be the <i>principal</i> cause of a gathered
breast; and, as the subject is of immense importance,
I cannot do better than give it in his own words, more
especially as he has the merit of originating and of
bringing the subject prominently before his professional
brethren. He says: “This (mammary abscess or gathered
breast) is another form of disease entirely referable
to the cause under consideration [fruitless sucking].
In the case last related, the formation of mammary
abscess [gathered breast] was only just prevented by
arresting any further irritation of the breast by suckling;
and since I have kept careful notes of my cases,
I have observed that in all instances of abscess there
has been abundant evidence of a demand being made
upon the gland for a supply of milk beyond that which
it had the power of secreting. If the child <i>only</i> has
been kept to the breast, then <i>it</i> has suffered with
disordered bowels; but in the majority of cases an
additional irritation has been applied; the commonly-received
doctrine that a turgid breast is necessarily
overloaded with milk, leads mothers and nurses to
the use of breast-pumps, exhausted bottles, or even
the application of the powerful sucking powers of the
nurse herself, to relieve the breasts of their supposed
excess; and it is this extraordinary irritation which, in
the majority of cases, determines the formation of an
abscess [gathering]. Sometimes these measures are
adopted to remove the milk when a woman is not
going to suckle, and then an abscess not unfrequently
is established. I have previously alluded to the mistake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>into which mothers and nurses are led by the appearance
of a swollen breast; it is not evidence that
the gland can secrete freely, and it is in this turgid
state that the excessive irritation tells most severely.
This hyperæmic [plethoric] condition seems to be a
step toward inflammation, and the irritation supplies
that which is wanting to complete the process. If a
woman will only remove the child from the breast directly
the act of sucking produces pain, she may be
pretty sure to avoid abscess. So long as the milk can
be obtained there is no pain.” The above most valuable
advice deserves great attention, and ought to be
strictly followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>693. <i>How is a patient to know that she is about to
have a gathered bosom?</i>—There are two forms of
gathered breast; one being of vast and the other of
trifling importance. The first, the serious one, consists
of gathering of the <i>structure of the gland</i> of the breast
itself; the latter, merely of the <i>superficial part</i> of the
bosom, and ought to be treated in the same manner as
any other <i>external</i> gathering, with warm poultices.</p>

<p class='c008'>694. In the <i>mild</i> or superficial kind of gathered
bosom, the mother may still persevere in suckling her
child, as the secreting portion of the breast is not at all
implicated in the gathering; but in the <i>severe</i> form,
she ought not, on any account whatever, to be allowed
to do so, but should instantly wean her child from the
affected side. The <i>healthy</i> breast she may still continue
to nurse from.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>695. The <i>important</i> form of a gathered breast I will
now describe: A severe gathered bosom is always
ushered in with a shivering fit. Let this fact be impressed
deeply upon my reader’s mind. This shivering
is either accompanied or followed by sharp lancinating
pains of the bosom. The breast now greatly enlarges,
becomes hot, and <i>is very painful</i>. The milk in the
affected bosom either lessens or entirely disappears. If
the child be applied to the breast (which he ought not
to be), it gives the mother <i>intense</i> pain. She is now
feverish and ill; she loses her strength and appetite,
and is very thirsty.</p>

<p class='c008'>696. A medical man must, at the very <i>onset</i> of the
shivering fit, be sent for; and he will, in the generality
of instances, be able to prevent such a painful and distressing
occurrence as a gathered breast. If twelve
hours be allowed to elapse after the shivering has taken
place, the chances are that the gathering cannot altogether
be prevented; although even then it may, by
judicious treatment, be materially lessened and ameliorated.</p>

<p class='c008'>697. We sometimes hear of a poor woman suffering
dreadfully for months, and of her having a dozen or
twenty holes in her bosom! This is generally owing
to the doctor not having been sent for <i>immediately</i>
after the shivering; I therefore cannot too strongly insist,
under such circumstances, upon a mother obtaining
<i>prompt</i> assistance, not only to obviate present
suffering, but, at the same time, to prevent the function
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of the breast from being injured, which it inevitably,
more or less, will be, if the <i>important</i> form of gathering
be allowed to take place.</p>

<p class='c008'>698. When a nursing mother <i>feels faint</i>, she ought
<i>immediately</i> to lie down and to take a little nourishment;
either a crust of bread and a draught of ale or
of porter, or a glass of wine, or a cup of tea with the
yelk of an egg beaten up in it, either of which will
answer the purpose extremely well. Brandy, or any
other spirit, I would not recommend, as it will only
cause, as soon as the <i>immediate</i> effects of the brandy
are gone off, a greater depression to ensue; not only
so, but the <i>frequent</i> taking of brandy might become a
habit—a necessity which would be a calamity deeply
to be deplored!</p>

<p class='c008'>699. A mother is sometimes faint from suckling her
child too often, she having him almost constantly at
the bosom. So long, of course, as she continues this
foolish practice, she must expect to suffer from faintness.</p>

<p class='c008'>700. <i>Aperients, etc. during suckling.</i>—Strong purgatives,
during this period, are highly improper, as
they are apt to give pain to the infant as well as to
injure the mother. If it be absolutely necessary to
give an aperient, the mildest, such as a dose of castor
oil, should be chosen.</p>

<p class='c008'>701. If she cannot take oil, then she should apply it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span><i>externally</i> to the bowels as a liniment, as recommended
at page <a href='#Page_144'>144</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>702. An enema, either of warm water, or of gruel,
oil, and table salt,<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a> applied by means of a good self-injecting
enema apparatus, is in such a case an excellent—indeed,
the very best—method of opening the
bowels, as it neither interferes with the digestion of
the mother nor of the child.</p>

<p class='c008'>703. The less opening medicine, whatever be the
kind, a mother who is suckling takes, the better will it
be both for herself and for her babe. Even castor oil,
the least objectionable, during suckling, of aperients, if
she once begin to take it <i>regularly</i>, the bowels will not
act without it, and a wretched state of things is established.
No, if the bowels will not act, an enema is by
far the best remedy; you can never do any harm,
either to the mother or to the babe, by the administration
of an enema; it will neither induce future constipation,
nor will it interfere with the digestion of the
mother, nor with the bowels, nor with the health of
the infant.</p>

<p class='c008'>704. When a lady who is nursing is habitually costive,
she ought to eat brown instead of white-bread.
This will, in the majority of cases, enable her to do
without an aperient. The brown bread may be made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>by mixing one part of bran and three parts of fine
wheaten flour together, and then making it in the
usual way into bread. Treacle instead of butter on the
brown bread increases its efficacy as an aperient.</p>

<p class='c008'>705. Either stewed prunes or stewed French plums
are an excellent remedy to prevent constipation. The
patient ought to eat, every morning, a dozen or fifteen
of them. The best way to stew either prunes or French
plums is the following: Put a pound, either of prunes
or of French plums, and two tablespoonfuls of <i>raw</i>
sugar, into a brown jar; cover them with water, put
them into a slow oven, and stew them for three or four
hours. Both stewed rhubarb and stewed pears often
act as mild or gentle aperients. Muscatel raisins, eaten
at dessert, will oftentimes, without medicine, relieve
the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>706. A Bee-master in <cite>The Times</cite>, or, as he is usually
called, <cite>The Times</cite> Bee-master, has satisfactorily proved
that honey—pure honey—is most wholesome and beneficial
to the human economy. He recommends it to be
occasionally eaten in lieu of butter for breakfast. Butter,
in some localities, and in some seasons of the year,
is far from good and wholesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>707. The Germans are in the habit of eating for
breakfast and for tea a variety of fruit jams instead of
butter with their bread. Now, if the bowels be costive,
jam is an excellent substitute for butter. The Scotch,
too, scarcely ever sit down either to breakfast or tea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>without there being a pot of marmalade on the tables.
English ladies, in this matter, may well take a leaf out
of the books of the Germans and of the Scotch.</p>

<p class='c008'>708. A basinful of gruel, made either with Robinson’s
Patent Groats, or with the Derbyshire oatmeal, sweetened
with <i>brown</i> sugar, every night for supper will often
supersede the necessity of giving opening medicine. A
tumblerful of cold spring water—cold from the pump—taken
<i>early</i> every morning, sometimes effectually relieves
the bowels. Coffee ought to be substituted for
tea for breakfast, as coffee frequently acts as an aperient,
more especially if the coffee be sweetened with brown
sugar. A glass of sherry should be taken every day
<i>during</i> dinner, as, if the bowels be sluggish, it sometimes
stimulates them to action. I should strongly recommend
a patient, in such a case, to eat a great variety of
food, and to let the <i>vegetable</i> element predominate.
<i>Much</i> meat encourages constipation. Fruit—Muscatel
raisins especially—farinaceous food, coffee, and a
variety of vegetables, each and all incite the bowels to
do their duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>709. Although a nursing mother ought, more especially
if she be costive, to take a variety of <i>well-cooked</i>
vegetables—such as potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower,
French beans, stewed celery, and turnips; she
should avoid eating greens, cabbages, and pickles, as
they would be likely to affect the baby, and might cause
him to suffer from gripings, pain, and “looseness” of
the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>710. The “wet compress” is another excellent method
of opening the bowels. The way of applying it
is as follows: Fold a large napkin a few thicknesses
until it is about half a foot square; then dip it in <i>cold</i>
water and place it over the bowels; over which apply
either oilskin or gutta-percha skin, which should be, in
order to exclude the air, considerably larger than the
folded napkin. It should be kept in its place by means
of either a bolster-case or a broad bandage, and must
be applied at bedtime, and ought to remain on for three
or four hours, or until the bowels be opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>711. Let me again—for it cannot be too urgently insisted
upon—strongly advise a nursing mother to use
every means in the way of diet, etc., to supersede the
necessity of the taking of opening medicine, as the repetition
of aperients injures, and that severely, both
mother and child. Moreover, the more opening medicine
a person swallows, the more she requires; so that
if she once get into the habit of regularly taking aperients,
the bowels will not act without them. What a
miserable existence, to be always swallowing physic!</p>

<p class='c008'>712. If a lady, then, during the period of suckling,
were to take systematic exercise in the open air; to
bustle about the house and to attend to her household
duties; if she were to drink, the moment she awakes in
the morning, a tumbler of <i>cold</i> water, and every day
<i>during</i> dinner a glass of sherry; if she were to substitute
<i>brown</i> bread for <i>white</i> bread, and <i>coffee</i> for <i>tea</i> at
breakfast, and <i>brown</i> for <i>white</i> sugar; if she were to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>vary her food, both animal and vegetable, and partake
plentifully of sound ripe fruit; if she were to use an
abundance of <i>cold</i> water to her skin; if she were, occasionally,
at bedtime, to apply a “wet compress” to her
bowels, and to visit the water-closet daily at one hour;
if she were—even if the bowels were not opened for
four or five days—<i>not</i> to take an aperient of any kind
whatever, and avoid quacking herself with physic; in
short, if she would adopt the above safe and simple
remedies, which are in the reach of all, she would not
suffer so much from costiveness, which is frequently the
bane, the misery, and the curse of her existence! But
then, to get the bowels into a proper and healthy state,
it would take both time and trouble; and how readily
can a couple of pills be swallowed, and how quickly
they act, and how soon they have to be repeated; until
at length the bowels will not act at all unless goaded
into action, and the pills become a necessity! Oh, the
folly and the mischief of such a system!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>WEANING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>713. There is an old saying, “that a woman should
carry her child nine months, and should suckle him
nine months.” It is well known that the first part of
the old adage is correct, and experience has proved the
latter to be equally so. If a babe be weaned <i>before</i> he
be nine months, he loses that muscular strength which
the breast-milk alone can give; if he be suckled <i>after</i>
he be nine months, he becomes flabby, weak, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>delicate. “It is generally recognized that the healthiest
children are those weaned at nine months complete.
Prolonged nursing hurts both child and mother; in the
child, causing a tendency to brain disease, probably
through disordered digestion and nutrition; in the
mother, causing a strong tendency to deafness and
blindness. It is a very singular fact, to which it is
desirable that attention were paid, that in those districts
of Scotland—viz., the Highland and insular—where
the mothers suckle their infants from fourteen to
eighteen months, deaf-dumbness and blindness prevail
to a very much larger extent among the people than in
districts where nine or ten months is the usual limit of
the nursing period.”<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>714. <i>The time, then, when an infant ought to be
weaned.</i>—“This, of course, must depend upon the
strength of the child, and upon the health of the mother:
nine months on an average is the proper time.
If she be delicate, it may be found necessary to wean
him at six months; or if he be weak, or laboring under
any disease, it may be well to continue suckling him
for twelve months; but after that time the breast will
do him more harm than good, and will, moreover, injure
the mother’s health.”<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>715. If he be suckled after he be twelve months old,
he is generally pale, flabby, unhealthy, and rickety;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>and the mother is usually nervous, emaciated, and
hysterical. A child who is suckled beyond the proper
time, more especially if there be any predisposition,
sometimes dies either of water on the brain, or of consumption
of the lungs, or of mesenteric disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>716. <i>The manner in which a mother ought to act
when she weans her child.</i>—“She must, as the word
signifies, do it gradually—that is to say, she should by
degrees give him less and less of the breast, and more
and more of artificial food; she ought, at length, only
to suckle him at night; and lastly, it would be well for
the mother either to send him away, or to leave him
at home, and for a few days to go away herself.”<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>717. “A good plan is for the nurse to have in the
bed a half-pint bottle of new milk, which, to prevent it
from turning sour, has been previously boiled, so as to
give a little to the child in lieu of the breast. The
warmth of the body will keep the milk of a proper
temperature; and will supersede the use of lamps, of
candle-frames, and other troublesome contrivances.”<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>718. If the mother be not able to leave home herself,
or to send her child <i>from</i> home, she ought then to
let the child sleep in another room, with some <i>responsible</i>
person—I say <i>responsible</i> person, for a baby must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>not be left to the tender mercies of a giggling, thoughtless
young girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>719. If the mother, during the daytime, cannot resist
having her child in the room with her, then I
should advise her to make a paste of aloes—that is to
say, let her mix a little powdered aloes with a few
drops of water, until it be of the consistence of paste—and
let her smear it on the nipple every time just before
putting him to the breast; this will be <i>quite</i> enough
for him; and one or two aloe applications to the nipple
will make him take a disgust to the bosom, and thus
the weaning will be accomplished. A mother need not
be afraid that the aloes will injure her baby; the <i>minute</i>
quantity he will swallow will do no harm; for the
moment he tastes it, the aloes being extremely bitter,
he will splutter it out of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>720. Another application for the nipple, to effect
weaning, is wormwood. There are two ways of applying
it, either (1) by sprinkling a very small pinch
of powdered wormwood on the nipple; or (2) by bathing
the nipple with a small quantity of wormwood tea
just before applying the babe to it—either the one or
the other of these plans will make him take a dislike
to the breast, and thus the weaning will be accomplished.
Wormwood is excessively bitter and disagreeable,
and a slight quantity of it on the nipple will
cause an infant to turn away from it with loathing and
disgust—the wormwood, the minute quantity he will
taste, will not at all injure him. Wormwood was in
Shakspeare’s time used for the purpose of weaning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the days of the year upon that day:</div>
      <div class='line'>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug [breast],</div>
      <div class='line'>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>My lord and you were then at Mantua:</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, I do bear a brain: but, as I said,</div>
      <div class='line'>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</div>
      <div class='line'>Of my dug, and felt it bitter, pretty fool!</div>
      <div class='line'>To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug.”<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>721. The best way of “<i>drying up the milk</i>” is to
apply to each breast soap plaster (<i>emplastrum saponis</i>),
spread on soft pieces of wash-leather, the shape and size
of the top of a hat, with a round hole the size of a shilling
in the middle of each to admit the nipple, and with
a slit from the center to the circumference of each plaster
to make a better fit. These plasters ought to be
spread by a chemist.</p>

<p class='c008'>722. When the child is once weaned, the breasts
ought <i>not</i> to be drawn, as the drawing of them would
cause them to secrete larger quantities of milk; if, therefore,
the bosoms be ever so full or uncomfortable, a
mother ought to leave them alone; she should wait
patiently, and the milk will gradually diminish, and
will at length disappear.</p>

<p class='c008'>723. The drawing of the bosoms, during weaning,
either by means of a breast-pump, or by the mouth, or
by other like contrivances, has frequently caused
gathered breasts. If not drawn, they scarcely, if
ever, gather.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>724. The foregoing plan of “drying up the milk” will
generally in five or six days assuage the milk away;
but if, at the end of three days, the bosoms still continue
full and uncomfortable, the plasters should be
removed, and the breasts ought, every four hours, to
be well but tenderly rubbed with equal parts of olive
oil and of <i>eau de Cologne</i>; the nurse supporting the
bosom, during such friction, with her other hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>725. Let me impress the above important advice on
a nursing mother’s mind; it might save a great deal
of after-suffering and misery.</p>

<p class='c008'>726. It might be well to state that, after the child
has been weaned, the milk does <i>not</i> always <i>entirely</i>
leave the breast, not even for weeks, and, in some
cases, not even for months; it is not of the slightest
consequence, and requires no treatment to get rid
of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>727. A mother ought, during the period of weaning,
to live abstemiously, and should drink as little as possible.
In many cases, it is necessary to give, every
morning, for two or three mornings, a few doses of
mild aperient medicine, such as either a Seidlitz powder,
or a teaspoonful of Henry’s magnesia and a teaspoonful
of Epsom salts in half a tumbler of warm
water.</p>

<p class='c008'>728. <i>Symptoms denoting the necessity of weaning.</i>—A
mother sometimes cannot suckle her child; the attempt
bringing on a train of symptoms somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>similar to the following: singing in the ears; dimness
of sight; aching of the eyeballs; throbbing in the
head; nervousness; hysterics; tremblings; faintness;
loss of appetite and of flesh; fluttering and palpitation
of the heart; feelings of great exhaustion; indigestion;
costiveness; sinking sensations of the stomach; pains
in the <i>left</i> side; great weakness and dragging pains of
the loins, which are usually increased whenever the
infant is put to the bosom; pallor of the countenance;
shortness of breath; swelling of the ankles.</p>

<p class='c008'>729. Of course, every mother who is suffering from
suckling does not have the <i>whole</i> of the above long
catalogue of symptoms! But if she has three or four
of the more serious of them, she ought not to disobey
the warnings, but should discontinue nursing; although
it may be necessary, if the babe himself be not old
enough to wean, to obtain a healthy wet-nurse to take
her place.</p>

<p class='c008'>730. Remember, then, that if the above warning
symptoms be disregarded, dangerous consequences,
both to parent and child, might be the result. It
might either throw the mother into a consumption, or
it might bring on heart disease; and, in consequence of
his not being able to obtain sufficient or proper nourishment,
it might cause the infant to dwindle and pine
away, and, eventually, to die of water on the brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>731. Soon after nine months’ nursing, “the monthly
courses” generally return. This is another warning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>that the babe ought <i>immediately</i> to be weaned, as the
milk will lessen both in quantity and in nourishment,
and the child in consequence will become delicate and
puny, and every day he is suckled will lose, instead of
gain, ground. I have known many children, from protracted
suckling, smaller at twelve months than they
were at nine months; and well they might be, as, after
nine months, the mother’s milk usually does them harm
instead of doing them good, and thus causes them to
dwindle away.</p>

<p class='c008'>732. At another time, although the above train of
symptoms does not occur, and notwithstanding she
may be in perfect health, a mother may not be able to
suckle her baby. Such a one usually has very small
breasts, and but little milk in them, and if she endeavor
to nurse her infant, it produces a <i>violent aching</i> of the
bosom. Should she disregard these warnings, and
should still persevere, it might produce inflammation
of the breast, which will probably end in a gathering.</p>

<p class='c008'>733. <i>An obstinate sore nipple is sometimes a symptom
denoting the necessity of weaning.</i>—When the nipples
are, and, notwithstanding judicious treatment, persistently
for some time continue, very sore, it is often an
indication that a lady ought to wean her baby. Long-continued,
obstinate sore nipples frequently occur in a
delicate woman, and speak, in language unmistakable,
that the child, as far as the mother herself is concerned,
must be weaned. Of course, if the infant be
not old enough to wean, when practicable a wet-nurse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>ought to take the mother’s place. If the above advice
were more frequently followed than it is, gathered
breasts, much suffering, and broken health would not
so frequently prevail as they now do.</p>

<p class='c008'>734. If a mother be predisposed to consumption; if
she has had spitting of blood; if she be subject to violent
palpitation of the heart; if she be laboring under
great debility and extreme delicacy of constitution; if
she has any of the above complaints or symptoms, she
ought not on any account to suckle her child, but
should by all means procure a healthy wet-nurse.</p>

<p class='c008'>735. Occasionally a mother suckles her infant when
she is pregnant. This is highly improper, as it not
only injures her own health, and may bring on a miscarriage,
but it is also prejudicial to the baby, and may
produce a delicacy of constitution from which he might
never recover.</p>

<hr class='c023'>

<p class='c008'>In conclusion, I fervently hope that this little book
will, through God’s blessing, be to my fair reader,
during the whole period of her wifehood, a friend in
her need, a guide in her difficulties, and a silent but
trusty counselor in all things pertaining to her health.
I sincerely trust that it will give her as much pleasure
in the reading of these pages as it has given me in the
writing of them.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>PREFACE.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The sale of this book is enormous; where hundreds were
formerly disposed of, thousands are now sold; and the sale
still increases with increasing velocity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The book has been a great success: I had the good fortune,
some thirty years ago, to turn up new ground—to hit
upon a mine, which I have, ever since, even until now, worked
with my best energy and ability. One cause of the immense
success this work has achieved is, that it treats of some subjects
which, although they be subjects of vital importance
to the well-being of children, all other works of a kindred
nature do not even touch upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have, during the last thirty years, been constantly on the
watch to give a mother additional and useful advice on the
management of her children; so that, in point of fact, this
present edition consists of more than treble the quantity of
information contained in the earlier editions. The quantity
is not only increased, but the quality is, I trust, greatly improved.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last edition, comprising five thousand copies, has been
rapidly exhausted: to supply the increased and increasing
demand, seven thousand copies of this—the <span class='sc'>Ninth Edition</span>—are
now published. The enormous, and, for a medical work,
unusually large sale, is most gratifying to me as well as to
my worthy publishers.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have taken great pains to improve the present edition:
much new matter has been introduced; several paragraphs
have been abridged; some portions have been rewritten—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_mv'>mv</span>my extended experience has enabled me to enter on many of
the subjects more fully, and, I trust, more usefully; and the
book has been throughout thoroughly revised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lord Chesterfield, in writing to his son, once said: “If I
had had longer time, I would have written you a shorter letter.”
Now, I have found time both to curtail some of the
passages of this work, and to remove many, indeed, a large
majority of the quotations from the text. I have, consequently,
been able to fill up the various spaces with much
original, and, I trust, useful matter; and thus, without materially
increasing the bulk of the book, to keep it within
reasonable bounds. The <i>notes</i> and <i>annotations</i> of Sir
<span class='sc'>Charles Locock</span> are, however, perfectly intact—they are too
valuable either to be omitted, or to be, in the slightest degree,
curtailed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The writing, revising, improving, and enlarging of this, and
of my other work—<cite>Advice to a Wife</cite>—have, for upwards of
a quarter of a century, been my absorbing occupation—my
engrossing study. I have loved, and cherished, and tended
the two books as though they were my children; and have,
in each successive edition, always striven to bring them, as
nearly as my abilities would allow, to a state of completeness—to
make them, in fact, a perfect <i>Vade-mecum</i> for Wives
and Mothers. I might truly say, that the occupation has
ever been to me a source of pure and unalloyed enjoyment.
The correction of the pages has often cheered me when I
have been in grief or in trouble, and has soothed me when, in
my profession, I have been either harassed or vexed: truly,
I have had my reward! My fervent desire is, that some portion
of the pleasure and comfort I have derived from the
writing of these books may be experienced by my readers. If
it be only a tithe of what I myself have felt, I shall be more
than amply rewarded for my pains.</p>

<p class='c025'><i>I hardly know so melancholy a reflection, as that Parents are necessarily
the sole directors of the management of Children; whether they
have, or have not judgment, penetration, or taste, to perform the task.</i>—<span class='sc'>Greville.</span></p>

<p class='c026'><i>Man’s breathing Miniature!</i>—<span class='sc'>Coleridge.</span></p>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'>PRELIMINARY CONVERSATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>1. <i>I wish to consult you on many subjects appertaining
to the management and the care of children,—will
you favor me with your advice and counsel?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I shall be happy to accede to your request, and to
give you the fruits of my experience in the clearest
manner I am able, and in the simplest language I can
command—freed from all technicalities. I will endeavor
to guide you in the management of the health
of your offspring;—I will describe to you the <i>symptoms</i>
of the diseases of children;—I will warn you of approaching
danger, in order that you may promptly apply
for medical assistance before disease has gained too
firm a footing;—I will give you the <i>treatment</i> on the
moment of some of their more pressing illnesses—when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1014'>1014</span>medical aid cannot quickly be procured, and where
delay may be death;—I will instruct you, in case of
accidents, on the <i>immediate</i> employment of remedies—where
procrastination may be dangerous;—I will tell
you how a sick child should be nursed, and how a sick
room ought to be managed;—I will use my best energy
to banish injurious practices from the nursery;—I will
treat of the means to prevent disease where it be possible;—I
will show you the way to preserve the health
of the healthy,—and how to strengthen the delicate;—and
will strive to make a medical man’s task more
agreeable to himself,—and more beneficial to his patient,—by
dispelling errors and prejudices, and by
proving the importance of your <i>strictly</i> adhering to his
rules. If I can accomplish any of these objects, I shall
be amply repaid by the pleasing satisfaction that I
have been of some little service to the rising generation.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. <i>Then you consider it important that I should be
made acquainted with, and be well informed upon, the
subjects you have just named?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly. I deem it to be your imperative duty to
<i>study</i> the subjects well. The proper management of
children is a vital question,—a mother’s question,—and
the most important that can be brought under the consideration
of a parent; and, strange to say, it is one
that has been more neglected than any other. How
many mothers undertake the responsible management
of children without previous instruction, or without
forethought; they undertake it as though it may be
learned either by intuition or by instinct or by affection!
The consequence is, that frequently they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1015'>1015</span>in a sea of trouble and uncertainty, tossing about without
either rule or compass; until, too often, their hopes
and treasures are shipwrecked and lost!</p>

<p class='c008'>The care and management, and consequently the
health and future well-doing of the child, principally
devolve upon the mother; “for it is the mother after
all that has most to do with the making or the marring
of the man.”<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a> Dr. Guthrie justly remarks that—“Moses
might never have been the man he was unless
he had been nursed by his own mother. How many
celebrated men have owed their greatness and their
goodness to a mother’s training!” Napoleon owed
much to his mother. “‘The fate of a child,’ said Napoleon,
‘is always the work of his mother;’ and this
extraordinary man took pleasure in repeating, that to
his mother he owed his elevation. All history confirms
this opinion.... The character of the
mother influences the children more than that of the
father, because it is more exposed to their daily, hourly
observation.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I am not overstating the importance of the subject
in hand when I say that a child is the most valuable
treasure in the world, that “he is the precious gift
of God,” that he is the source of a mother’s greatest
and purest enjoyment, that he is the strongest bond
of affection between her and her husband, and that</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'>ABLUTION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>3. <i>Is a new-born infant, for the first time, to be
washed in warm or in cold water?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is not an uncommon plan to use <i>cold</i> water from
the first, under the impression of its strengthening the
child. This appears to be a cruel and barbarous practice,
and is likely to have a contrary tendency. Moreover,
it frequently produces either inflammation of the
eyes, or stuffing of the nose, or inflammation of the
lungs, or looseness of the bowels. Although I do not
approve of <i>cold</i> water, we ought not to run into an
opposite extreme, as <i>hot</i> water would weaken and enervate
the babe, and thus would predispose him to disease.
Lukewarm <i>rain</i> water will be the best to wash
him with. This, if it be summer, should have its
temperature gradually lowered, until it be quite cold;
if it be winter, a <i>dash</i> of warm water ought still to be
added, to take off the chill.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be necessary to use soap—Castile soap being
the best for the purpose—it being less irritating to the
skin than the ordinary soap. Care should be taken
that it does not get into the eyes, as it may produce
either inflammation or smarting of those organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the skin be delicate, or if there be any excoriation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1017'>1017</span>or “breaking-out” on the skin, then Glycerin soap,
instead of the Castile soap, ought to be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. <i>At what age do you recommend a mother to commence
washing her infant in the tub or in the nursery-basin?</i><a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the navel-string comes away.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> Do not
be afraid of water,—and that in plenty,—as it is one
of the best strengtheners to a child’s constitution.
How many infants suffer, for the want of water, from
excoriation!</p>

<p class='c008'>5. <i>Which do you prefer—flannel or sponge—to wash
a child with?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>For the first part of the washing a piece of flannel
is very useful—that is to say, to use with the soap,
and to loosen the dirt and the perspiration; but for the
finishing-up process, a sponge—a large sponge—is superior
to flannel, to wash all away, and to complete the
bathing. A sponge cleanses and gets into all the
nooks, corners, and crevices of the skin. Besides,
sponge, to finish up with, is softer and more agreeable
to the tender skin of a child than flannel. Moreover,
a sponge holds more water than flannel, and thus enables
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1018'>1018</span>you to stream the water more effectually over him.
A large sponge will act like a miniature shower-bath,
and will thus brace and strengthen him.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. <i>To prevent a new-born babe from catching cold,
is it necessary to wash his head with brandy?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is <i>not</i> necessary. The idea that it will prevent
cold is erroneous, as the rapid evaporation of heat
which the brandy causes is more likely to give than to
prevent cold?</p>

<p class='c008'>7. <i>Ought that tenacious, paste-like substance, adhering
to the skin of a new-born babe, to be washed off at
the first dressing?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It should, provided it be done with a soft sponge and
with care. If there be any difficulty in removing the
substance, gently rub it, by means of a flannel,<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a> either
with a little lard, or fresh butter, or sweet oil. After
the parts have been well smeared and gently rubbed
with the lard, or oil, or butter, let all be washed off
together, and be thoroughly cleansed away, by means
of a sponge and soap and warm water, and then, to
complete the process, gently put him for a minute or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1019'>1019</span>two in his tub. If this paste-like substance be allowed
to remain on the skin, it might produce either an excoriation
or a “breaking-out.” Besides, it is impossible,
if that tenacious substance be allowed to remain
on it, for the skin to perform its proper functions.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. <i>Have you any general observations to make on the
washing of a new-born infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A babe ought, every morning of his life, to be
thoroughly washed from head to foot; and this can
only be properly done by putting him bodily either
into a tub, or into a bath, or into a large nursery-basin
half filled with water. The head, before placing him
in the bath, should be first wetted (but not dried); then
immediately put him into the water, and, with a piece
of flannel well soaked, cleanse his whole body, particularly
his armpits, between his thighs, his groins, and
his hams; then take a large sponge in hand, and allow
the water from it, well filled, to stream all over his
body, particularly over his back and loins. Let this
advice be well observed, and you will find the plan
most strengthening to your child. The skin must, after
every bath, be thoroughly but quickly dried with warm,
dry, soft towels, first enveloping the child in one, and
then gently absorbing the moisture with the towel, not
roughly scrubbing and rubbing his tender skin as
though a horse were being rubbed down.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ears must after each ablution be carefully and
well dried with a soft dry napkin; inattention to this
advice has sometimes caused a gathering in the ear—a
painful and distressing complaint; and at other times
it has produced deafness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1020'>1020</span>Directly after the infant is dried, all the parts that
are at all likely to be chafed ought to be well powdered.
After he is well dried and powdered, the chest, the
back, the bowels, and the limbs should be gently rubbed,
taking care not to expose him unnecessarily during such
friction.</p>

<p class='c008'>He ought to be partially washed every evening; indeed
it may be necessary to use a sponge and a little
warm water frequently during the day, namely, each
time after the bowels have been relieved. <i>Cleanliness
is one of the grand incentives to health</i>, and therefore
cannot be too strongly insisted upon. If more attention
were paid to this subject, children would be more
exempt from chafings, “breakings-out,” and consequent
suffering, than they at present are. After the second
month, if the babe be delicate, the addition of two
handfuls of table salt to the water he is washed with in
the morning will tend to brace and strengthen him.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the best powder to dust an infant
with, there is nothing better for general use than starch—the
old-fashioned starch <i>made of wheaten flour</i>—reduced
by means of a pestle and mortar to a fine
powder; or Violet Powder, which is nothing more than
finely-powdered starch scented, and which may be procured
of any respectable chemist. Some mothers are
in the habit of using white lead; but as this is a poison,
it ought <i>on no account</i> to be resorted to.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>9. <i>If the parts about the groin and fundament be
excoriated, what is then the best application?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1021'>1021</span>After sponging the parts with tepid <i>rain</i> water, holding
him over his tub, and allowing the water from a
well-filled sponge to stream over the parts, and then
drying them with a soft napkin (not rubbing, but
gently dabbing with the napkin), there is nothing better
than dusting the parts frequently with finely-powdered
Native Carbonate of Zinc. The best way of
using this powder is, tying up a little of it in a piece of
muslin, and then gently dabbing the parts with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember excoriations are generally owing to the
want of water—to the want of an abundance of water.
An infant who is every morning well soused and well
swilled with water, seldom suffers either from excoriations
or from any other of the numerous skin diseases.
Cleanliness, then, is the grand preventive of, and the
best remedy for, excoriations. Naaman the Syrian was
ordered “to wash and be clean,” and he was healed,
“and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little
child, and he was clean.”<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a> This was, of course, a miracle;
but how often does water, without any special intervention,
act miraculously both in preventing and in
curing skin diseases!</p>

<p class='c008'>An infant’s clothes, napkins especially, ought never
to be washed with soda; the washing of napkins with
soda is apt to produce excoriations and breakings-out.
“As washerwomen often deny that they use soda, it
can be easily detected by simply soaking a clean napkin
in fresh water and then tasting the water; if it be
brackish and salt, soda has been employed.”<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1022'>1022</span>10. <i>Who is the proper person to wash and dress the
babe?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The monthly nurse, as long as she is in attendance;
but afterward the mother, unless she should happen to
have an experienced, sensible, thoughtful nurse, which,
unfortunately, is seldom the case.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>11. <i>What is the best kind of apron for a mother, or
for a nurse to wear, while washing the infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Flannel—a good, thick, soft flannel, usually called
bath-coating—apron, made long and full, and which of
course ought to be well dried every time before it is
used.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. <i>Perhaps you will kindly recapitulate, and give
me further advice on the subject of the ablution of my
babe?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let him by all means, then, as soon as the navel-string
has separated from the body, be bathed either <i>in</i>
his tub, or <i>in</i> his bath, or <i>in</i> his large nursery-basin; for
if he is to be strong and hearty, <i>in</i> the water every
morning he must go. The water ought to be slightly
warmer than new milk. It is dangerous for him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1023'>1023</span>remain for a long period in his bath; this, of course,
holds good in a tenfold degree if the child has either a
cold, or a pain in his bowels. Take care that, immediately
after he comes out of his tub, he is well dried
with warm towels. It is well to let him have his bath
the first thing in the morning, and before he has been
put to the breast; let him be washed before he has his
breakfast; it will refresh him and give him an appetite.
Besides, he ought to have his morning ablution on an
empty stomach, or it may interfere with digestion, and
might produce sickness and pain. In putting him in
his tub, let his head be the first part washed. We all
know, that in bathing in the sea, how much better we
can bear the water if we first wet our head; if we do
not do so, we feel shivering and starved and miserable.
Let there be no dawdling in the washing; let it be
quickly over. When he is thoroughly dried with warm
<i>dry</i> towels, let him be well rubbed with the warm hand
of the mother or of the nurse. As I previously recommended,
while drying him and while rubbing him, let
him repose and kick and stretch either on the warm
flannel apron, or else on a small blanket placed on the
lap. One bathing in the tub, and that in the morning,
is sufficient, and better than night and morning.
During the day, as I before observed, he may, after the
action either of his bowels or of his bladder, require
several spongings of lukewarm water, <i>for cleanliness is
a grand incentive to health and comeliness</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember it is absolutely necessary to every child
from his earliest babyhood to have a bath, to be immersed
every morning of his life in the water. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1024'>1024</span>advice, unless in cases of severe illness, admits of no
exception. Water to the body—to the whole body—is
a necessity of life, of health, and of happiness; it wards
off disease, it braces the nerves, it hardens the frame,
it is the finest tonic in the world. Oh, if every mother
would follow to the very letter this advice, how much
misery, how much ill health, might then be averted!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>MANAGEMENT OF THE NAVEL.</h4>

<p class='c018'>13. <i>Should the navel-string be wrapped in</i> <span class='fss'>SINGED</span>
<i>rag?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is nothing better than a piece of fine old linen
rag, <i>unsinged</i>; when singed, it frequently irritates the
infant’s skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>14. <i>How ought the navel-string to be wrapped in the
rag?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Take a piece of soft linen rag, about three inches
wide and four inches long, and wrap it neatly round the
navel-string, in the same manner you would around a
cut finger, and then, to keep on the rag, tie it with a
few rounds of whity-brown thread. The navel-string
thus covered should, pointing upward, be placed on
the belly of the child, and must be secured in its place
by means of a flannel belly-band.</p>

<p class='c008'>15. <i>If, after the navel-string has been secured, bleeding
should (in the absence of the medical man) occur,
how must it be restrained?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The nurse or the attendant ought immediately to take
off the rag, and tightly, with a ligature composed of
four or five whity-brown threads, retie the navel-string;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1025'>1025</span>and to make assurance doubly sure, after once tying it,
she should pass the threads a second time around the
navel-string and tie it again; and after carefully ascertaining
that it no longer bleeds, fasten it up in the rag
as before. Bleeding of the navel-string rarely occurs,
yet, if it should do so—the medical man not being at
hand—the child’s after-health, or even his life, may, if
the above directions be not adopted, be endangered.</p>

<p class='c008'>16. <i>When does the navel-string separate from the
child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>From five days to a week after birth; in some cases
not until ten days or a fortnight, or even, in rare cases,
not until three weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>17. <i>If the navel-string does not at the end of a week
come away, ought any means to be used to cause the
separation?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not; it ought always to be allowed to drop
off, which, when in a fit state, it will readily do. Meddling
with the navel-string has frequently cost the
babe a great deal of suffering, and in some cases even
his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>18. <i>The navel is sometimes a little sore after the
navel-string comes away; what ought then to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A little simple cerate should be spread on lint, and
be applied every morning to the part affected; and a
white-bread poultice, every night, until it be quite
healed.</p>

<p class='c008'>19. <i>What are the causes of a rupture of the navel?
What ought to be done? Can it be cured?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>(1.) A rupture of the navel is sometimes occasioned
by a meddlesome nurse. She is very anxious to cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1026'>1026</span>the navel-string to separate from the infant’s body, more
especially when it is longer in coming away than usual.
She, therefore, before it is in a fit state to drop off, forces
it away. (2.) The rupture, at another time, is occasioned
by the child incessantly crying. A mother, then,
should always bear in mind that a rupture of the navel
is often caused by much crying, and that it occasions
much crying; indeed, it is a frequent cause of incessant
crying. A child, therefore, who, without any assignable
cause, is constantly crying, should have his navel
carefully examined.</p>

<p class='c008'>A rupture of the navel ought always to be treated
early—the earlier the better. Ruptures of the navel
can only be <i>cured</i> in infancy and in childhood. If it
be allowed to run on until adult age, a <i>cure</i> is impossible.
Palliative means can then only be adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best treatment is a Burgundy pitch plaster,
spread on a soft piece of wash-leather about the size
of the top of a tumbler, with a properly adjusted pad
(made from the plaster) fastened on the center of the
plaster, which will effectually keep up the rupture, and
in a few weeks will cure it. It will be necessary, from
time to time, to renew the plaster until the cure be
effected. These plasters will be found both more efficacious
and pleasant than either a truss or an elastic
bandage; which latter appliances sometimes gall, and
do more harm than they do good.</p>

<p class='c008'>20. <i>If a child has a groin rupture (an inguinal rupture),
can that also be cured?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly, if, soon after birth, it be properly attended
to. Consult a medical man, and he will supply you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1027'>1027</span>with a well-fitting truss, <i>which will eventually cure
him</i>. If the truss be properly made (under the direction
of an experienced surgeon) by a skillful surgical-instrument-maker,
a beautiful, nicely fitting truss will
be supplied, which will take the proper and exact
curve of the lower part of the infant’s belly, and will
thus keep on without using any under-strap whatever—a
great desideratum, as these under-straps are so
constantly wetted and soiled as to endanger the patient
constantly catching cold. But if this under-strap
is to be superseded, the truss must be made exactly to
fit the child—to fit him like a ribbon; which is a difficult
thing to accomplish, unless it be fashioned by a
skillful workman. It is only lately that these trusses
have been made without under-straps. Formerly the
under-straps were indispensable necessaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>These groin ruptures require great attention and supervision,
as the rupture (the bowel) must, before putting
on the truss, be cautiously and thoroughly returned
into the belly; and much care should be used to prevent
the chafing and galling of the tender skin of the babe,
which an ill-fitting truss would be sure to occasion.
But if care and skill be bestowed on the case, a perfect
cure might in due time be insured. The truss must
not be discontinued until a <i>perfect</i> cure be effected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me strongly urge you to see that my advice is
carried out to the very letter, as a groin rupture can
only be <i>cured</i> in infancy and in childhood. If it be
allowed to run on, unattended to, until adult age, he
will be obliged to wear a truss <i>all his life</i>, which would
be a great annoyance and a perpetual irritation to him.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'>CLOTHING.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>21. <i>Is it necessary to have a flannel cap in readiness
to put on as soon as a babe is born?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Charles Locock considers that a flannel cap is
<i>not</i> necessary, and asserts that all his best nurses have
long discarded flannel caps. Sir Charles states that
since the discontinuance of flannel caps infants have
not been more liable to inflammation of the eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such authority is, in my opinion, conclusive. My
advice, therefore, to you is, by all means discontinue
the use of flannel caps.</p>

<p class='c008'>22. <i>What kind of belly-band do you recommend—a
flannel or a calico one?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I prefer flannel, for two reasons—first, on account
of its keeping the child’s bowels comfortably warm;
and, secondly, because of its not chilling him (and
thus endangering cold, etc.) when he wets himself.
The belly-band ought to be moderately but not tightly
applied, as, if tightly applied, it would interfere with
the necessary movement of the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>23. <i>When should the belly-band be discontinued?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>When the child is two or three months old. The
best way of leaving it off is to tear a strip off daily for
a few mornings, and then to leave it off altogether.
“Nurses who take charge of an infant when the
monthly nurse leaves are frequently in the habit of at
once leaving off the belly-band, which often leads to
ruptures when the child cries or strains. It is far
wiser to retain it too long than too short a time; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1029'>1029</span>when a child catches hooping-cough while still very
young, it is safer to resume the belly-band.”<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>24. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the clothing
of an infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A baby’s clothing ought to be light, warm, loose, and
free from pins. (1.) <i>It should be light</i>, without being
too airy. Many infants’ clothes are both too long and
too cumbersome. It is really painful to see how some
poor little babies are weighed down with a weight of
clothes. They may be said to “bear the burden,” and
that a heavy one, from the very commencement of
their lives! How absurd, too, the practice of making
them wear <i>long</i> clothes. Clothes to cover a child’s
feet, and even a little beyond, may be desirable; but
for clothes, when the infant is carried about, to reach
to the ground, is foolish and cruel in the extreme. I
have seen a delicate baby almost ready to faint under
the infliction. (2.) <i>It should be warm</i>, without being
too warm. The parts that ought to be kept warm are
the chest, the bowels, and the feet. If the infant be
delicate, especially if he be subject to inflammation of
the lungs, he ought to wear a fine flannel, instead of
his usual shirts, which should be changed as frequently.
(3.) <i>The dress should be loose</i>, so as to prevent
any pressure upon the blood-vessels, which would
otherwise impede the circulation, and thus hinder a
proper development of the parts. It ought to be loose
about the chest and waist, so that the lungs and the
heart may have free play. It should be loose about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1030'>1030</span>the stomach, so that digestion may not be impeded;
it ought to be loose about the bowels, in order that the
spiral motion of the intestines may not be interfered
with; hence the importance of putting on a belly-band
moderately slack; it should be loose about the sleeves,
so that the blood may course, without let or hindrance,
through the arteries and veins; it ought to be loose,
then, everywhere, for nature delights in freedom from
restraint, and will resent, sooner or later, any interference.
Oh that a mother would take common sense,
and not custom, as her guide! (4.) <i>As few pins</i>
should be used in the dressing of a baby as possible.
Inattention to this advice has caused many a little
sufferer to be thrown into convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The generality of mothers use no pins in the dressing
of their children; they tack with a needle and thread
every part that requires fastening. They do not even
use pins to fasten the baby’s napkins. They make the
diapers with loops and tapes, and thus altogether supersede
the use of pins in the dressing of an infant. The
plan is a good one, takes very little extra time, and
deserves to be universally adopted. If pins be used
for the napkins, they ought to be the Patent Safety
Pins.</p>

<p class='c008'>25. <i>Is there any necessity for a nurse being particular
in airing an infant’s clothes before they are put
on? If she were less particular, would it not make
him more hardy?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A nurse cannot be too particular on this head. A
baby’s clothes ought to be well aired the day before
they are put on, as they should <i>not</i> be put on warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1031'>1031</span>from the fire. It is well, where it can be done, to let
him have clean clothes daily. Where this cannot be
afforded, the clothes, as soon as they are taken off at
night, ought to be well aired so as to free them from
the perspiration, and that they may be ready to put on
the following morning. It is truly nonsensical to endeavor
to harden a child, or any one else, by putting
on damp clothes!</p>

<p class='c008'>26. <i>What is your opinion of caps for an infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The head ought to be kept cool; caps, therefore, are
unnecessary. If caps be used at all, they should only
be worn for the first month in summer, or for the first
two or three months in winter. If a babe take to caps,
it requires care in leaving them off, or he will catch
cold. When you are about discontinuing them, put a
thinner and a thinner one on, every time they are
changed, until you leave them off altogether.</p>

<p class='c008'>But remember, my opinion is, that a child is better
<i>without</i> caps; they only heat his head, cause undue
perspiration, and thus make him more liable to catch
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a babe does not wear a cap in the day, it is not
at all necessary that he should wear one at night. He
will sleep more comfortably without one, and it will be
better for his health. Moreover, night-caps injure both
the thickness and the beauty of the hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>27. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the clothing
of an infant, when, in the winter time, he is sent out
for exercise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Be sure that he is well wrapped up. He ought to
have under his cloak a knitted worsted spencer, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1032'>1032</span>should button behind; and if the weather be very cold,
a shawl over all; and, provided it be dry above, and
the wind be not in the east or in the northeast, he may
then brave the weather. He will then come from his
walk refreshed and strengthened, for cold air is an invigorating
tonic. In a subsequent conversation I will
indicate the proper age at which a child should be first
sent out to take exercise in the open air.</p>

<p class='c008'>28. <i>At what age ought an infant “to be shortened?”</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This, of course, will depend upon the season. In
the summer, the right time “for shortening a babe,”
as it is called, is at the end of two months; in the
winter, at the end of three months. But if the right
time for “shortening” a child should happen to be in
the spring, let it be deferred until the end of May. The
English springs are very trying and treacherous; and
sometimes, in April, the weather is almost as cold, and
the wind as biting, as in winter. It is treacherous, for
the sun is hot, and the wind, which is at this time of
the year frequently easterly, is keen and cutting. I
should far prefer “to shorten” a child in the winter
than in the early spring.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DIET.</h4>

<p class='c018'>29. <i>Are you an advocate for putting a baby to the
breast soon after birth, or for waiting, as many do, until
the third day?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The infant ought to be put to the breast soon after
birth; the interest, both of the mother and of the child,
demands it. It will be advisable to wait three or four
hours, that the mother may recover from her fatigue;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1033'>1033</span>and then the babe must be put to the breast. If this
be done, he will generally take the nipple with avidity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might be said that at so early a period there is
no milk in the breast; but such is not usually the case.
There generally is a <i>little</i> from the very beginning;
which acts on the baby’s bowels like a dose of purgative
medicine, and appears to be intended by nature to
cleanse the system. But, provided there be no milk at
first, the very act of sucking not only gives the child a
notion, but, at the same time, causes a draught (as it
is usually called) in the breast, and enables the milk
to flow easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, if there be <i>no</i> milk in the breast—the babe
having been applied once or twice to determine the fact—then
you must wait for a few hours before applying
him again to the nipple, that is to say, until the milk
be secreted.</p>

<p class='c008'>An infant who, for two or three days, is kept from
the breast, and who is fed upon gruel, generally becomes
feeble, and frequently, at the end of that time,
will not take the nipple at all. Besides, there is a thick
cream (similar to the biestings of a cow), which, if not
drawn out by the child, may cause inflammation and
gathering of the bosom, and, consequently, great suffering
to the mother. Moreover, placing him <i>early</i> to
the breast moderates the severity of the mother’s after pains,
and lessens the risk of her flooding. A new-born
babe must <i>not</i> have gruel given to him; as it disorders
the bowels, causes a disinclination to suck, and
thus makes him feeble.</p>

<p class='c008'>30. <i>If an infant show any disinclination to suck, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1034'>1034</span>if he appear unable to apply his tongue to the nipple,
what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately call the attention of the medical man to
the fact, in order that he may ascertain whether he be
tongue-tied. If he be, the simple operation of dividing
the bridle of the tongue will remedy the defect, and
will cause him to take the nipple with ease and comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>31. <i>Provided there be no milk</i> <span class='fss'>AT FIRST</span>; <i>what ought
then to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Wait with patience: the child (if the mother has no
milk) will not, for at least twelve hours, require artificial
food. In the generality of instances, then, artificial
food is not at all necessary; but if it should be
needed, one-third of new milk and two-thirds of warm
water, slightly sweetened with loaf sugar (or with
brown sugar, if the babe’s bowels have not been
opened), should be given, in small quantities at a time,
every four hours, until the milk be secreted, and then
it must be discontinued. The infant ought to be put
to the nipple every four hours, but not oftener, until he
be able to find nourishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, after the application of the child for a few times,
he is unable to find nourishment, then it will be necessary
to wait until the milk be secreted. As soon as it
is secreted, he must be applied, with great regularity,
<i>alternately</i> to each breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>I say <i>alternately</i> to each breast. <i>This is most important
advice.</i> Sometimes a child, for some inexplicable
reason, prefers one breast to the other, and the
mother, to save a little contention, concedes the point,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1035'>1035</span>and allows him to have his own way. And what is
frequently the consequence?—a gathered breast!</p>

<p class='c008'>We frequently hear of a babe having no notion of
sucking. This “no notion” may generally be traced
to bad management, to stuffing him with food, and thus
giving him a disinclination to take the nipple at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>32. <i>How often should a mother suckle her infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A mother generally suckles her baby too often, having
him almost constantly at the breast. This practice
is injurious both to parent and to child. The stomach
requires repose as much as any other part of the body;
and how can it have it if it be constantly loaded with
breast-milk? For the first month, he ought to be
suckled about every hour and a half; for the second
month, every two hours,—gradually increasing, as he
becomes older, the distance of time between, until at
length he has it about every four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a baby were suckled at stated periods, he would
only look for the bosom at those times, and be satisfied.
A mother is frequently in the habit of giving the child
the breast every time he cries, regardless of the cause.
The cause too frequently is, that he has been too often
suckled—his stomach has been overloaded; the little
fellow is constantly in pain, and he gives utterance to
it by cries. How absurd is such a practice! We may
as well endeavor to put out a fire by feeding it with
fuel. An infant ought to be accustomed to regularity
in every thing—in times for suckling, for sleeping, etc.
No children thrive so well as those who are thus early
taught.</p>

<p class='c008'>33. <i>Where the mother is</i> <span class='fss'>MODERATELY</span> <i>strong, do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1036'>1036</span>advise that the infant should have any other food than
the breast?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Artificial food must not, for the first three or four
months, be given, if the parent be <i>moderately</i> strong;
of course, if she be feeble, a <i>little</i> food will be necessary.
Many delicate women enjoy better health while suckling
than at any other period of their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>34. <i>What food is the best substitute for a mother’s
milk?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The food that suits one infant will not agree with
another. (1.) The one that I have found the most
generally useful, is made as follows: Boil the crumb
of bread for two hours in water, taking particular care
that it does not burn; then add only a <i>little</i> lump sugar
(or <i>brown</i> sugar, if the bowels be costive), to make it
palatable. When he is five or six months old, mix a
little new milk—the milk of <span class='fss'>ONE</span> cow—with it, gradually,
as he becomes older, increasing the quantity until
it be nearly all milk, there being only enough water to
boil the bread; the milk should be poured boiling hot
on the bread. Sometimes the two milks—the mother’s
and the cow’s milk—do not agree; when such is the
case, let the milk be left out, both in this and in the
foods following, and let the food be made with water
instead of with milk and water. In other respects,
until the child is weaned, let it be made as above
directed; when he is weaned, good fresh cow’s milk
<span class='fss'>MUST</span>, as previously recommended, be used. (2.) Or,
cut thin slices of bread into a basin, cover the bread
with <i>cold</i> water, place it in an oven for two hours to
bake; take it out, beat the bread up with a fork, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1037'>1037</span>then slightly sweeten it. This is an excellent food.
(3.) If the above should not agree with the infant
(although, if properly made, they almost invariably do),
“tous-les-mois”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c014'><sup>[141]</sup></a> may be given. (4.) Or, Robb’s Biscuit,
as it is “among the best bread compounds made
out of wheat-flour, and is almost always readily digested.”—<i>Routh.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>(5.) Another good food is the following: Take
about a pound of flour, put it in a cloth, tie it up
tightly, place it in a saucepanful of water, and let it
boil for four or five hours; then take it out, peel off the
outer rind, and the inside will be found quite dry, which
grate. (6.) Another way of preparing an infant’s food,
is to bake flour—biscuit flour—in a slow oven, until it
be of a light fawn color. (7.) An excellent food for a
baby, is baked crumbs of bread. The manner of preparing
it is as follows: Crumb some bread on a plate;
put it a little distance from the fire to dry. When dry,
rub the crumbs in a mortar, and reduce them to a fine
powder; then pass them through a sieve. Having done
which, put the crumbs of bread into a slow oven, and let
them bake until they be of a light fawn color. A small
quantity either of the boiled, or of the baked flour, or
of the baked crumb of bread, ought to be made into
food in the same way as gruel is made, and should then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1038'>1038</span>be slightly sweetened, according to the state of the
bowels, either with lump or with brown sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>(8.) Baked flour sometimes produces constipation;
when such is the case, Mr. Appleton of Budleigh Salterton,
Devon, wisely recommends a mixture of baked
flour and prepared oatmeal,<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> in the proportion of two of
the former and one of the latter. He says: “To
avoid the constipating effects, I have always had mixed,
before baking, one part of prepared oatmeal with two
parts of flour; this compound I have found both nourishing,
and regulating to the bowels. One tablespoonful
of it, mixed with a quarter of a pint of milk, or milk
and water, when well boiled, flavored, and sweetened
with white sugar, produces a thick, nourishing, and
delicious food for infants or invalids.” He goes on to
remark: “I know of no food, after repeated trials, that
can be so strongly recommended by the profession to
all mothers in the rearing of their infants, without or
with the aid of the breast, at the same time relieving
them of much draining and dragging while nursing
with an insufficiency of milk, as baked flour and oatmeal.”<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>(9.) A ninth food may be made with “Farinaceous
Food for Infants, prepared by Hards of Dartford.” If
Hards’ Farinaceous Food produces costiveness—as it
sometimes does—let it be mixed either with equal parts
or with one-third of Robertson’s Patent Groats. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1039'>1039</span>mixture of the two together makes a splendid food for
a baby. (10.) A tenth, and an excellent one, may be
made with rusks, boiled for an hour in water, which
ought then to be well beaten up by means of a fork,
and slightly sweetened with lump sugar. Great care
should be taken to select good rusks, as few articles
vary so much in quality. (11.) An eleventh is—the
top crust of a baker’s loaf, boiled for an hour in water,
and then moderately sweetened with lump sugar. If,
at any time, the child’s bowels should be costive, <i>raw</i>
must be substituted for <i>lump</i> sugar. (12.) Another
capital food for an infant, is that made by Lemann’s
Biscuit Powder. (13.) Or, Brown and Polson’s Patent
Corn Flour will be found suitable. The Queen’s cook,
in his recent valuable work,<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a> gives the following formula
for making it: “To one dessertspoonful of Brown
&#38; Polson, mixed with a wineglassful of cold water, add
half a pint of boiling water; stir over the fire for five
minutes; sweeten lightly, and feed the baby; but if the
infant is being brought up by the hand, this food should
then be mixed with milk—not otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>(14.) The following is a good and nourishing food
for a baby: Soak, for an hour, some <i>best</i> rice in cold
water; strain, and add fresh water to the rice; then let
it simmer till it will pulp through a sieve; put the pulp
and the water in a saucepan, with a lump or two of
sugar, and again let it simmer for a quarter of an hour;
a portion of this should be mixed with one-third of fresh
milk, so as to make it of the consistence of good cream.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1040'>1040</span>When the baby is five or six months old, new milk
should be added to any of the above articles of food, in
a similar way to that recommended for boiled bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>(15.) For a delicate infant, lentil powder, better
known as Du Barry’s “Revalenta Arabica,” is invaluable.
It ought to be made into food, with new milk,
in the same way that arrow-root is made, and should
be moderately sweetened with loaf sugar. Whatever
food is selected ought to be given by means of a nursing-bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a child’s bowels be relaxed and weak, or if the
motions be offensive, the milk <i>must</i> be boiled. The following
(16.) is a good food when an infant’s bowels
are weak and relaxed: “Into five large spoonfuls of
the purest water rub smooth one dessertspoonful of
fine flour. Set over the fire five spoonfuls of new milk,
and put two bits of sugar into it; the moment it boils,
pour it into the flour and water, and stir it over a slow
fire twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Where there is much emaciation, I have found (17.)
genuine arrow-root a very valuable article of food for
an infant, as it contains a great deal of starch, which
starch helps to form fat and to evolve caloric (heat)—both
of which a poor, emaciated, chilly child stands so
much in need of. It must be made with good fresh
milk, and ought to be slightly sweetened with loaf
sugar; a small pinch of table salt should be added to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have given you a large and well-tried infant’s
dietary to choose from, as it is sometimes difficult to fix
on one that will suit; but remember, if you find one of
the above to agree, keep to it, as a baby requires a
simplicity in food—a child a greater variety.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1041'>1041</span>Let me, in this place, insist upon the necessity of
great care and attention being observed in the preparation
of any of the above articles of diet. A babe’s
stomach is very delicate, and will revolt at either ill-made,
or lumpy, or burnt food. Great care ought to
be observed as to the cleanliness of the cooking utensils.
The above directions require the strict supervision
of the mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broths have been recommended, but, for my own
part, I think that, for a <i>young</i> infant, they are objectionable;
they are apt to turn acid on the stomach, and
to cause flatulence and sickness; they sometimes disorder
the bowels and induce griping and purging.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever artificial food is used ought to be given by
means of a bottle, not only as it is a more natural way
than any other of feeding a baby, as it causes him to
suck as though he were drawing it from the mother’s
breast, but as the act of sucking causes the salivary
glands to press out their contents, which materially
assists digestion. Moreover, it seems to satisfy and
comfort him more than it otherwise would do.</p>

<p class='c008'>The food ought to be of the consistence of good
cream, and should be made fresh and fresh. It ought
to be given milk-warm. Attention must be paid to the
cleanliness of the vessel, and care should be taken that
the milk be that of <span class='fss'>ONE</span> cow,<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a> and that it be new and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1042'>1042</span>of good quality; for if not, it will turn acid and sour,
and disorder the stomach, and will thus cause either
flatulence or looseness of the bowels, or perhaps convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only way to be sure of having it from <i>one</i> cow,
is (if you have not a cow of your own) to have the
milk from a <i>respectable</i> cow-keeper, and to have it
brought to your house in a can of your own (the London
milk-cans being the best for the purpose). The
better plan is to have two cans, and to have the milk
fresh and fresh every night and morning. The cans,
after each time of using, ought to be scalded out; and,
once a week, the can should be filled with <i>cold</i> water,
and the water should be allowed to remain in it until
the can be again required.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very little sugar should be used in the food, as much
sugar weakens the digestion. A small pinch of table
salt ought to be added to whatever food is given, as
“the best savor is salt.” Salt is most wholesome—it
strengthens and assists digestion, prevents the formation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1043'>1043</span>of worms, and, in small quantities, may with advantage
be given (if artificial food be used) to the
youngest baby.</p>

<p class='c008'>35. <i>Where it is found to be absolutely necessary to
give an infant artificial food</i> <span class='fss'>WHILE SUCKLING</span>, <i>how
often ought he to be fed?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Not oftener than twice during the twenty-four hours,
and then only in <i>small</i> quantities at a time, as the
stomach requires rest, and at the same time can manage
to digest a little food better than it can a great
deal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me again urge upon you the importance, if it be
at all practicable, of keeping the child <i>entirely</i> to the
breast for the first three or four months of his existence.
Remember there is no <i>real</i> substitute for a mother’s
milk; there is no food so well adapted to his stomach;
there is no diet equal to it in developing muscle, in
making bone, or in producing that beautiful plump
rounded contour of the limbs; there is nothing like a
mother’s milk <i>alone</i> in making a child contented and
happy, in laying the foundation of a healthy constitution,
in preparing the body for a long life, in giving
him tone to resist disease, or in causing him to cut his
teeth easily and well; in short, <i>the mother’s milk is
the greatest temporal blessing an infant can possess</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a general rule, therefore, when the child and the
mother are tolerably strong, he is better <i>without artificial</i>
food until he has attained the age of three or four
months; then, it will usually be necessary to feed him
twice a day, so as gradually to prepare him to be
weaned (if possible) at the end of nine months. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1044'>1044</span>food mentioned in the foregoing conversation will be
the best for him, commencing <i>without</i> the cow’s milk,
but gradually adding it, as less mother’s milk and more
artificial food be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>36. <i>When the mother is not able to suckle her infant
herself, what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It must first be ascertained, <i>beyond all doubt</i>, that a
mother is not able to suckle her own child. Many
delicate ladies do suckle their infants with advantage,
not only to their offspring, but to themselves. “I will
maintain,” says Steele, “that the mother grows stronger
by it, and will have her health better than she would
have otherwise. She will find it the greatest cure and
preservative for the vapors [nervousness] and future
miscarriages, much beyond any other remedy whatsoever.
Her children will be like giants, whereas otherwise
they are but living shadows, and like unripe fruit;
and certainly if a woman is strong enough to bring
forth a child, she is beyond all doubt strong enough to
nurse it afterward.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Many mothers are never so well as when they are
nursing; besides, suckling prevents a lady from becoming
pregnant so frequently as she otherwise would.
This, if she be delicate, is an important consideration,
and more especially if she be subject to miscarry. The
effects of a miscarriage are far more weakening than
those of suckling.</p>

<p class='c008'>A hireling, let her be ever so well inclined, can never
have the affection and unceasing assiduity of a mother,
and, therefore, cannot perform the duties of suckling
with equal advantage to the baby.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1045'>1045</span>The number of children who die under five years of
age is enormous—many of them from the want of the
mother’s milk. There is a regular “parental baby-slaughter”—“a
massacre of the innocents”—constantly
going on in England, in consequence of infants
being thus deprived of their proper nutriment and just
dues! The mortality from this cause is frightful, chiefly
occurring among rich people who are either too grand,
or, from luxury, too delicate, to perform such duties:
poor married women, as a rule, nurse their own children,
and, in consequence, reap their reward.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it be ascertained, <i>past all doubt</i>, that a mother
cannot suckle her child, then, if the circumstances of
the parents will allow—and they ought to strain a
point to accomplish it—a healthy wet-nurse should be
procured, as, of course, the food which nature has supplied
is far, very far superior to any invented by art.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never bring up a baby, then, if you can possibly
avoid it, on <i>artificial</i> food. Remember, as I proved
in a former conversation, there is in early infancy no
<i>real</i> substitute for either a mother’s or a wet-nurse’s
milk. It is impossible to imitate the admirable and
subtle chemistry of nature. The law of nature is, that
a baby, for the first few months of his existence, shall
be brought up by the breast; and nature’s law cannot
be broken with impunity.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a> It will be imperatively
necessary, then—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1046'>1046</span>“To give to nature what is nature’s due.”<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Again, in case of a severe illness occurring during the
first nine months of a child’s life, what a comfort either
the mother’s or the wet-nurse’s milk is to him! it often
determines whether he shall live or die.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if a wet-nurse cannot fill the place of a mother,
then, asses’ milk will be found the best substitute, as
it approaches nearer, in composition, than any other
animal’s, to human milk; but it is both difficult and
expensive to obtain. The next best substitute is goats’
milk. Either the one or the other ought to be milked
fresh and fresh, as it is wanted, and should be given
by means of a feeding-bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Asses’ milk is more suitable for <i>delicate</i> infants, and
goats’ milk for those who are <i>strong</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If neither asses’ milk nor goats’ milk can be procured,
then the following from the very commencement
should be given:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>New milk, the produce of <span class='fss'>ONE</span> <i>healthy</i> cow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Warm water, of each, equal parts;</div>
      <div class='line'>Table salt,<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a> a few grains;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lump sugar, a sufficient quantity to slightly sweeten it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The milk itself ought not to be heated over the fire,<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1047'>1047</span>but should, as above directed, be warmed by the water;
it must, morning and evening, be had fresh and fresh.
The milk and water should be of the same temperature
as the mother’s milk, that is to say, at about ninety to
ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. It ought to be given
by means of a feeding-bottle, and care must be taken
to <i>scald</i> the bottle out twice a day, for if attention be
not paid to this point the delicate stomach of an infant
is soon disordered. As he grows older the milk should
be gradually increased, and the water decreased, until
nearly all milk be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>There will, in many cases, be quite sufficient nourishment
in the above; I have known some robust infants
brought up on it alone. But if it should not agree with
the child, or if there should not be sufficient nourishment
in it, then the food recommended in answer to
No. 34 question ought to be given, with this only difference—a
little new milk <i>must</i> from the beginning be
added, and should be gradually increased, until nearly
all milk be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>The milk, as a general rule, ought to be <i>unboiled</i>;
but if it purge violently, or if it cause offensive motions—which
it sometimes does—then it must be boiled.
The moment the milk boils up it should be taken off
the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Food ought, for the first month, to be given about
every two hours; for the second month, about every
three hours; lengthening the space of time as the baby
advances in age. A mother must be careful not to
over-feed a child, as over-feeding is a prolific source of
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1048'>1048</span>Let it be thoroughly understood, and let there be
no mistake about it, that a babe, during the first nine
months of his life, <span class='fss'>MUST</span> have—it is absolutely necessary
for his very existence—milk of some kind, as the staple
and principal article of his diet, either mother’s, or wet-nurse’s,
or asses’, or goat’s, or cow’s own milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>37. <i>How would you choose a wet-nurse?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I would inquire particularly into the state of her
health; whether she be of a healthy family, of a consumptive
habit, or if she or any of her family have
labored under “king’s evil;” ascertaining if there be
any seams or swellings about her neck; any eruptions
or blotches upon her skin; if she has a plentiful breast
of milk, and if it be of good quality<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a> (which may
readily be ascertained by milking a little into a glass);
if she has good nipples, sufficiently long for the baby
to hold; that they be not sore; and if her own child be
of the same or nearly of the same age as the one you
wish her to nurse. Ascertain whether she menstruates
during suckling; if she does, the milk is not so good
and nourishing, and you had better decline taking her.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
Assure yourself that her own babe is strong and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1049'>1049</span>healthy, and that he is free from a sore mouth and from
a “breaking-out” of the skin. Indeed, if it be possible
to procure such a wet-nurse, she ought to be from the
country, of ruddy complexion, of clear skin, and of between
twenty and five and twenty years of age, as the
milk will then be fresh, pure, and nourishing.</p>

<p class='c008'>I consider it to be of great importance that the infant
of the wet-nurse should be, as nearly as possible,
of the same age as your own, as the milk varies in
quality according to the age of the child. For instance,
during the commencement of suckling, the milk is thick
and creamy, similar to the biestings of a cow, which,
if given to a babe of a few months old, would cause derangement
of the stomach and bowels. After the first
few days, the appearance of the milk changes; it becomes
of a bluish-white color, and contains less nourishment.
The milk gradually becomes more and more
nourishing as the infant becomes older and requires
more support.</p>

<p class='c008'>In selecting a wet-nurse for a very small and feeble
babe, you must carefully ascertain that the nipples of
the wet-nurse are good and soft, and yet not very large:
if they be very large, the child’s mouth being very small,
he may not be able to hold them. You must note, too,
whether the milk flows readily from the nipple into the
child’s mouth; if it does not, he may not have strength
to draw it, and he would soon die of starvation. The
only way of ascertaining whether the infant actually
draws the milk from the nipple, can be done by examining
the mouth of the child <i>immediately</i> after his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1050'>1050</span>taking the breast, and seeing for yourself whether there
be actually milk in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very feeble new-born babes sometimes cannot take
the bosom, be the nipples and the breasts ever so good.
In such a case, cow’s milk and water, sugar and salt,
as recommended at page <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>, must be given in small
quantities at a time—from two to four teaspoonfuls—but
frequently; if the child be awake, every hour or
every half hour, both night and day, until he be able
to take the breast. If, then, a puny, feeble babe is only
able to take but little at a time, and that little by teaspoonfuls,
he must have little and often, in order that
“many a little might make a mickle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I have known many puny, delicate children who had
not strength to hold the nipple in their mouths, but
who could take milk and water (as above recommended)
by teaspoonfuls only at a time, with steady perseverance,
and giving it every half hour or hour (according
to the quantity swallowed), at length be able to take
the breast, and eventually become strong and hearty
children; but such cases require unwearied watching,
perseverance, and care. Bear in mind, then, that the
smaller the quantity of the milk and water given at a
time, the oftener must it be administered, as, of course,
the babe must have a certain quantity of food to sustain
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>38. <i>What ought to be the diet either of a wet-nurse,
or of a mother who is suckling?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is a common practice to cram a wet-nurse with
food, and to give her strong ale to drink, to make good
nourishment and plentiful milk! This practice is absurd;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1051'>1051</span>for it either, by making the nurse feverish, makes
the milk more sparing than usual, or it causes the milk
to be gross and unwholesome. On the other hand, we
must not run into an opposite extreme. The mother,
or the wet-nurse, by using those means most conducive
to her own health, will best advance the interest of her
little charge.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wet-nurse ought to live somewhat in the following
way: Let her for breakfast have black tea, with one or
two slices of cold meat, if her appetite demand it, but
not otherwise. It is customary for a wet-nurse to
make a hearty luncheon; of this I do not approve. If
she feel either faint or low at eleven o’clock, let her
have either a tumbler of porter, or of mild fresh ale,
with a piece of dry toast soaked in it. She ought not
to dine later than half past one or two o’clock; she
should eat, for dinner, either mutton or beef, with either
mealy potatoes, or asparagus, or French beans, or
secale, or turnips, or brocoli, or cauliflower, and stale
bread. Rich pastry, soups, gravies, high-seasoned
dishes, salted meats, greens, and cabbage must one and
all be carefully avoided, as they only tend to disorder
the stomach, and thus to deteriorate the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a common remark, that “a mother who is suckling
may eat anything.” I do not agree with this
opinion. Can impure or improper food make pure
and proper milk, or can impure or improper milk make
good blood for an infant, and thus good health?</p>

<p class='c008'>The wet-nurse ought to take with her dinner a moderate
quantity of either sound porter, or of mild (but not
old or strong) ale. Tea should be taken at half past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1052'>1052</span>five or six o’clock; supper at nine, which should consist
either of a slice or two of cold meat, or of cheese if
she prefer it, with half a pint of porter or of mild ale;
occasionally, a basin of gruel may with advantage be
substituted. Hot and late suppers are prejudicial to
the mother or to the wet-nurse, and, consequently, to
the child. The wet-nurse ought to be in bed every
night by ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might be said that I have been too minute and
particular in my rules for a wet-nurse; but when it is
considered of what importance good milk is to the well-doing
of an infant, in making him strong and robust,
not only now, but as he grows up to manhood, I shall,
I trust, be excused for my prolixity.</p>

<p class='c008'>39. <i>Have you any more hints to offer with regard to
the management of a wet-nurse?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A wet-nurse is frequently allowed to remain in bed
until a late hour in the morning, and during the day
to continue in the house, as if she were a fixture! How
is it possible that any one, under such treatment, can
continue healthy?</p>

<p class='c008'>A wet-nurse ought to rise early, and, if the weather
and season will permit, take a walk, which will give
her an appetite for breakfast and will make a good
meal for her little charge. This, of course, cannot,
during the winter months, be done; but even then, she
ought, some part of the day, to take every opportunity
of walking out; indeed, in the summer time she should
live half the day in the open air.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ought strictly to avoid crowded rooms; her mind
should be kept calm and unruffled, as nothing disorders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1053'>1053</span>the milk so much as passion and other violent
emotions of the mind; a fretful temper is very injurious,
on which account you should, in choosing your
wet-nurse, endeavor to procure one of a mild, calm, and
placid disposition.<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>A wet-nurse ought never to be allowed to dose her
little charge either with Godfrey’s Cordial, or with
Dalby’s Carminative, or with Syrup of White Poppies,
or with medicine of any kind whatever. Let her thoroughly
understand this, and let there be no mistake in
the matter. Do not, for one moment, allow your children’s
health to be tampered and trifled with. A baby’s
health is too precious to be doctored, to be experimented
upon, and to be ruined by an ignorant person.</p>

<p class='c008'>40. <i>Have the goodness to state at what age a child
ought to be weaned?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This, of course, must depend both upon the strength
of the child and upon the health of the parent; on an
average, nine months is the proper time. If the mother
be delicate it may be found necessary to wean the
infant at six months; or if he be weak, or laboring
under any disease, it may be well to continue suckling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1054'>1054</span>him for twelve months; but after that time the breast
will do him more harm than good, and will, moreover,
injure the mother’s health, and may, if she be so predisposed,
excite consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>41. <i>How would you recommend a mother to act
when she weans her child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>She ought, as the word signifies, do it gradually—that
is to say, she should, by degrees, give him less
and less of the breast, and more and more of artificial
food; at length she must only suckle him at night;
and lastly, it would be well for the mother either to
send him away, or to leave him at home, and, for a few
days, to go away herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>A good plan is, for the nurse-maid to have a half-pint
bottle of new milk—which has been previously
boiled<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a>—in the bed, so as to give a little to him in lieu
of the breast. The warmth of the body will keep the
milk of a proper temperature, and will supersede the
use of lamps, of candle-frames, and other troublesome
contrivances.</p>

<p class='c008'>42. <i>While a mother is weaning her infant, and after
she has weaned him, what ought to be his diet?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Any one of the foods recommended in answer to
question 34, page <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>43. <i>If a child be suffering severely from “wind,”
is there any objection to the addition of a small quantity
either of gin or of peppermint to his food to disperse
it?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1055'>1055</span>It is a murderous practice to add either gin or peppermint
of the shops (which is oil of peppermint dissolved
in spirits) to his food. Many children have, by
such a practice, been made puny and delicate, and have
gradually dropped into an untimely grave. An infant
who is kept, for the first three or four months, <i>entirely</i>
to the breast—more especially if the mother be careful
in her own diet—seldom suffers from “wind;” those,
on the contrary, who have much or improper food,<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a>
suffer severely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Care in feeding, then, is the grand preventive of
“wind;” but if, notwithstanding all your precautions,
the child be troubled with flatulence, the remedies recommended
under the head of Flatulence will generally
answer the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>44. <i>Have you any remarks to make on sugar for
sweetening a baby’s food?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>small</i> quantity of sugar in an infant’s food is requisite,
sugar being nourishing and fattening, and making
cows’ milk to resemble somewhat in its properties
human milk; but, bear in mind, <i>it must be used sparingly</i>.
<i>Much</i> sugar cloys the stomach, weakens the
digestion, produces acidity, sour belchings, and wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a baby’s bowels be either regular or relaxed, <i>lump</i>
sugar is the best for the purpose of sweetening his food;
if his bowels are inclined to be costive, <i>brown</i> sugar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1056'>1056</span>ought to be substituted for lump sugar, as <i>brown</i> sugar
acts on a young babe as an aperient, and, in the generality
of cases, is far preferable to physicking him with
opening medicine. An infant’s bowels, whenever it be
practicable (and it generally is), ought to be regulated
by a judicious dietary rather than by physic.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>VACCINATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>45. <i>Are you an advocate for vaccination?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly. I consider it to be one of the greatest
blessings ever conferred upon mankind. Small-pox,
before vaccination was adopted, ravaged the country
like a plague, and carried off thousands annually; and
those who did escape with their lives were frequently
made loathsome and disgusting objects by it. Even
inoculation (which is cutting for the small-pox) was
attended with danger—more especially to the unprotected—as
it caused the disease to spread like wildfire,
and thus it carried off immense numbers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vaccination is one and an important cause of our
increasing population; small-pox, in olden times, decimated
the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>46. <i>But vaccination does not always protect a child
from small-pox?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I grant you that it does not <i>always</i> protect him,
<i>neither does inoculation</i>; but when he is vaccinated, if
he take the infection, he is seldom pitted, and very
rarely dies, and the disease assumes a comparatively
mild form. There are a few, very few fatal cases recorded
after vaccination, and these may be considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1057'>1057</span>as only exceptions to the general rule; and, possibly
some of these may be traced to the arm, when the
child was vaccinated, not having taken proper effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>If children and adults were <i>revaccinated</i>,—say
every seven years after the first vaccination,—depend
upon it, even these rare cases would not occur, and in
a short time small-pox would only be known by name.</p>

<p class='c008'>47. <i>Do you consider it, then, the imperative duty of
a mother in every case to have, after the lapse of every
seven years, her children revaccinated?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I decidedly do; it would be an excellent plan for
<i>every</i> person, once every seven years, to be revaccinated,
and even oftener, if small-pox be rife in the
neighborhood. Vaccination, however frequently performed,
can never do the slightest harm, and might do
inestimable good. Small-pox is both a pest and a disgrace,
and ought to be constantly fought and battled
with until it be banished (which it may readily be) the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>I say that small-pox is a pest; it is worse than the
plague, for if not kept in subjection it is more general—sparing
neither young nor old, rich nor poor, and commits
greater ravages than the plague ever did. Small-pox
is a disgrace; it is a disgrace to any civilized land,
as there is no necessity for its presence: if cow-pox
were properly and frequently performed, small-pox
would be unknown. Cow-pox is a weapon to conquer
small-pox, and to drive it ignominiously from the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>My firm belief then is, that if <i>every</i> person were,
<i>every seven years</i>, duly and properly vaccinated, small-pox
might be utterly exterminated; but as long as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1058'>1058</span>there are such lax notions on the subject, and such
gross negligence, the disease will always be rampant,
for the poison of small-pox never slumbers nor sleeps,
but requires the utmost diligence to eradicate it. The
great Dr. Jenner, the discoverer of cow pox as a preventative
of small-pox, strongly advocated the absolute
necessity of <i>every</i> person being revaccinated once
every seven years, or even oftener, if there was an
epidemic of small-pox in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>48. <i>Are you not likely to catch not only the cow-pox,
but any other disease that the child has from whom the
matter is taken?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The same objection holds good in cutting for small-pox
(inoculation)—only in a tenfold degree—small-pox
being such a disgusting complaint. Inoculated small-pox
frequently produced and left behind inveterate
“breakings-out,” scars, cicatrices, and indentations of
the skin, sore eyes, blindness, loss of eyelashes, scrofula,
deafness—indeed, a long catalogue of loathsome diseases.
A medical man, of course, will be careful to
take the cow-pox matter from a healthy child.</p>

<p class='c008'>49. <i>Would it not be well to take the matter direct
from the cow?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If a doctor be careful—which, of course, he will be—to
take the matter from a healthy child, and from a
well-formed vesicle, I consider it better than taking it
<i>direct</i> from the cow, for the following reasons: The
cow-pox lymph, taken direct from the cow, produces
much more violent symptoms than after it has passed
through several persons; indeed, in some cases, it has
produced effects as severe as cutting for the small-pox;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1059'>1059</span>besides, it has caused, in many cases, violent inflammation
and even sloughing of the arm. There are
also several kinds of <i>spurious</i> cow-pox to which the
cow is subject, and which would be likely to be mistaken
for the <i>real</i> lymph. Again, if even the <i>genuine</i>
matter were not taken from the cow <i>exactly</i> at the
proper time, it would be deprived of its protecting
power.</p>

<p class='c008'>50. <i>At what age do you recommend an infant to be
first vaccinated?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>When he is two months old, as the sooner he is protected
the better. Moreover, the older he is the greater
will be the difficulty in making him submit to the operation,
and in preventing his arm from being rubbed,
thus endangering the breaking of the vesicles, and
thereby interfering with its effects. If small-pox be
prevalent in the neighborhood, he may, with perfect
safety, be vaccinated at the month’s end; indeed, if the
small-pox be near at hand, he <i>must</i> be vaccinated, regardless
of his age and regardless of everything else,
for small-pox spares neither the young nor the old, and
if a new-born babe should unfortunately catch the disease,
he will most likely die, as at his tender age he
would not have strength to battle with such a formidable
enemy. “A case in the General Lying-in-Hospital,
Lambeth, of small-pox occurred in a woman a
few days after her admission and the birth of her child.
Her own child was vaccinated when only four days
old, and all the other infants in the house, varying from
one day to a fortnight and more. All took the vaccination;
and the woman’s own child, which suckled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1060'>1060</span>her and slept with her; and all escaped the small-pox.”<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>51. <i>Do you consider that the taking of matter from
a child’s arm weakens the effect of vaccination on the
system?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not, provided it has taken effect in more
than one place. The arm is frequently much inflamed,
and vaccinating other children from it abates the inflammation,
and thus affords relief. <i>It is always well
to leave one vesicle undisturbed.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>52. <i>If the infant has any “breaking-out” upon the
skin, ought that to be a reason for deferring the vaccination?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It should, as two skin diseases cannot well go on together;
hence the cow-pox might not take, or, if it did,
might not have its proper effect in preventing small-pox.
“It is essential that the vaccine bud or germ have a
congenial soil, uncontaminated by another poison, which,
like a weed, might choke its healthy growth.”<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a> The
moment the skin be free from the breaking-out, he must
be vaccinated. A trifling skin affection, like red-gum,
unless it be severe, ought not, at the proper age, to
prevent vaccination. If small-pox be rife in the neighborhood,
the child <i>must</i> be vaccinated, regardless of
<i>any</i> “breaking-out” on the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>53. <i>Does vaccination make a child poorly?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>At about the fifth day after vaccination, and for three
or four days, he is generally a little feverish; the mouth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1061'>1061</span>is slightly hot, and he delights to have the nipple in
his mouth. He does not rest so well at night; he is
rather cross and irritable; and, sometimes, has a slight
bowel complaint. The arm, about the ninth or tenth
day, is usually much inflamed—that is to say, it is, for
an inch or two or more around the vesicles, red, hot,
and swollen, and continues in this state for a day or
two, at the end of which time the inflammation gradually
subsides. It might be well to state that the above
slight symptoms are desirable, as it proves that the
vaccination has had a proper effect on his system, and
that, consequently, he is more likely to be thoroughly
protected from any risk of catching small-pox.</p>

<p class='c008'>54. <i>Do you approve, either during or after vaccination,
of giving medicine, more especially if he be a
little feverish?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No; as it would be likely to work off some of its
effects, and thus would rob the cow-pox of its efficacy
on the system. I do not like to interfere with vaccination
<i>in any way whatever</i> (except, at the proper time,
to take a little matter from the arm), but to allow the
pock to have full power upon his constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>What do you give the medicine for? If the matter
that is put into the arm be healthy, what need is there
of physic? And if the matter be not of good quality,
I am quite sure that no physic will make it so! Look,
therefore, at the case in whatever way you like, physic
after vaccination is not necessary; but, on the contrary,
hurtful. If the vaccination produce a slight feverish
attack, it will, without the administration of a particle
of medicine, subside in two or three days.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1062'>1062</span>55. <i>Have you any directions to give respecting the
arm</i> <span class='fss'>AFTER</span> <i>vaccination?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The only precaution necessary, is to take care that
the arm be not rubbed; otherwise the vesicles may be
prematurely broken, and the efficacy of the vaccination
may be lessened. The sleeve, in vaccination, ought to
be large and soft, and should <i>not</i> be tied up. The
tying up of a sleeve makes it hard, and is much more
likely to rub the vesicles than if it were put on in the
usual way.</p>

<p class='c008'>56. <i>If the arm</i>, <span class='fss'>AFTER</span> <i>vaccination, be much inflamed,
what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Smear frequently, by means of a feather or a camel’s-hair
brash, a little cream on the inflamed part. This
simple remedy will afford great relief and comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>57. <i>Have the goodness to describe the proper appearance,
after the falling off of the scab, of the arm?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It might be well to remark that the scabs ought
always to be allowed to fall off of themselves. They
must not, on any account, be picked or meddled with.
With regard to the proper appearance of the arm after
the falling off of the scab, “a perfect vaccine scar
should be of small size, circular, and marked with
radiations and indentations.”<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'>DENTITION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>58. <i>At what time does dentition commence?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The period at which it commences is uncertain. It
may, as a rule, be said that a babe begins to cut his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1063'>1063</span>teeth at seven months old. Some have cut teeth at
three months; indeed, there are instances on record of
infants having been born with teeth. King Richard
the Third is said to have been an example. Shakspeare
notices it thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>York.</span>—Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast</div>
      <div class='line in8'>That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>’Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.”</div>
      <div class='line in48'><i>Act 2, sc. 5.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When a babe is born with teeth they generally drop
out. On the other hand, teething in some children
does not commence until they are a year and a half or
two years old, and, in rare cases, not until they are
three years old. There are cases recorded of adults
who have never cut any teeth. An instance of the
kind came under my own observation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dentition has been known to occur in old age. A
case is recorded by M. Carre, in the <i>Gazette Médicale
de Paris</i> (Sept. 15, 1860), of an old lady, aged eighty-five,
who cut several teeth after attaining that age!</p>

<p class='c008'>59. <i>What is the number of the</i> <span class='fss'>FIRST</span> <i>set of teeth, and
in what order do they generally appear?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The first or temporary set consists of twenty. The
first set of teeth are usually cut in pairs. “I may say
that nearly invariably the order is—1st, the lower front
incisors [cutting-teeth], then the upper front, then the
<i>upper</i> two lateral incisors, and that not uncommonly a
double tooth is cut before the two <i>lower</i> laterals; but
at all events the lower laterals come 7th and 8th, and
not 5th and 6th, as nearly all books on the subject testify”<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1064'>1064</span>Then the first grinders in the lower jaw, afterward
the first upper grinders, then the lower corner
pointed or canine teeth, after which the upper corner
or eye-teeth, then the second grinders in the lower jaw,
and lastly, the second grinders of the upper jaw. They
do not, of course, always appear in this rotation.
Nothing is more uncertain than the order of teething.
A child seldom cuts his second grinders until after he
is two years old. <i>He is usually, from the time they
first appear, two years in cutting his first set of teeth.</i>
As a rule, therefore, a child of two years old has sixteen,
and one of two years and a half old, twenty teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>60. <i>If an infant be either feverish or irritable, or
otherwise poorly, and if the gums be hot, swollen, and
tender, are you an advocate for their being lanced?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly; by doing so he will, in the generality of
instances, be almost instantly relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>61. <i>But it has been stated that lancing the gums hardens
them?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This is a mistake—it has a contrary effect. It is a
well-known fact that a part which has been divided
gives way much more readily than one which has not
been cut. Again, the tooth is bound down by a tight
membrane, which, if not released by lancing, frequently
brings on convulsions. If the symptoms be urgent, it
may be necessary from time to time to repeat the lancing.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would, of course, be the height of folly to lance
the gums unless they be hot and swollen, and unless
the tooth or the teeth be near at hand. It is not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1065'>1065</span>be considered a panacea for every baby’s ill, although,
in those cases where the lancing of the gums is indicated,
the beneficial effect is sometimes almost magical.</p>

<p class='c008'>62. <i>How ought the lancing of a child’s gums to be
performed?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The proper person, of course, to lance his gums is a
medical man. But, if perchance you should be miles
away and be out of the reach of one, it would be well
for you to know how the operation ought to be performed.
Well, then, let him lie on the nurse’s lap upon
his back, and let the nurse take hold of his hands, in
order that he may not interfere with the operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, <i>if it be the upper gum</i> that requires lancing,
you ought to go to the head of the child, looking over,
as it were, and into his mouth, and should steady the
gum with the index finger of your left hand; then you
should take hold of the gum-lancet with your right
hand—holding it as if it were a table-knife at dinner—and
cut firmly along the inflamed and swollen gum and
down to the tooth, until the edge of the gum-lancet
grates on the tooth. Each incision ought to extend
along the ridge of the gum to about the extent of each
expected tooth.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>If it be the lower gum</i> that requires lancing, you
must go to the side of the child, and should steady the
outside of the jaw with the fingers of the left hand,
and the gum with the left thumb, and then you should
perform the operation as before directed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the lancing of the gums, to make it intelligible
to a non-professional person, requires a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1066'>1066</span>description, it is, in point of fact, a simple affair, is
soon performed, and gives but little pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>63. <i>If teething cause convulsions, what ought to be
done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The first thing to be done (after sending for a medical
man) is to freely dash cold water upon the face,
and to sponge the head with cold water, and as soon
as warm water can be procured, to put him into a
warm bath<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c014'><sup>[159]</sup></a> of 98 degrees Fahrenheit. If a thermometer
be not at hand,<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a> you must plunge your own
elbow into the water: a comfortable heat for your
elbow will be the proper heat for the infant. He must
remain in the bath for a quarter of an hour, or until
the fit be at an end. The body must, after coming out
of the bath, be wiped with warm and dry and coarse
towels; he ought then to be placed in a warm blanket.
The gums must be lanced, and cold water should be
applied to the head. An enema, composed of table
salt, of olive oil, and warm oatmeal gruel—in the proportion
of one tablespoonful of salt, of one of oil, and
a teacupful of gruel—ought then to be administered,
and should, until the bowels have been well opened,
be repeated every quarter of an hour; as soon as he
comes to himself a dose of aperient medicine ought to
be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>64. <i>A nurse is in the habit of giving a child who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1067'>1067</span>teething either coral or ivory to bite—do you approve
of the plan?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I think it a bad practice to give him any hard, unyielding
substance, as it tends to harden the gums, and
by so doing causes the teeth to come through with
greater difficulty. I have found softer substances,
such as either a piece of wax-taper, or an india-rubber
ring, or a piece of the best bridle-leather, or a
crust of bread, of great service. If a piece of crust
be given as a gum-stick, he must, while biting it, be
well watched, or by accident he might loosen a large
piece of it, which might choke him. The pressure of
any of these excites a more rapid absorption of the
gum, and thus causes the tooth to come through more
easily and quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>65. <i>Have you any objection to my baby, when he is
cutting his teeth, sucking his thumb?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not; the thumb is the best gum-stick in
the world—it is convenient, it is handy (in every
sense of the word), it is of the right size, and of the
proper consistence—neither too hard nor too soft; there
is no danger, as of some artificial gum-sticks, of its
being swallowed, and thus of its choking the child.
The sucking of the thumb causes the salivary glands to
pour out their contents, and thus not only to moisten
the dry mouth, but assists the digestion; the pressure
of the thumb eases, while the teeth are “breeding,”
the pain and irritation of the gums, and helps, when
the teeth are sufficiently advanced, to bring them
through the gums. Sucking of the thumb will often
make a cross infant contented and happy, and will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1068'>1068</span>frequently induce a restless babe to fall into a sweet
refreshing sleep. Truly may the thumb be called a
baby’s comfort. By all means, then, let your child
suck his thumb whenever he likes, and as long as he
chooses to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a charming, bewitching little picture of a
babe sucking his thumb in Kingsley’s <cite>Water Babies</cite>,
which I cordially commend to your favorable notice
and study.</p>

<p class='c008'>66. <i>But if an infant be allowed to suck his thumb,
will it not be likely to become a habit, and stick to him
for years—until, indeed, he become a big boy?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>After he has cut the whole of his first set of teeth,
that is to say, when he is about two years and a half
old, he might, if it be likely to become a habit, be
readily cured by the following method, namely, by
making a paste of aloes and water and smearing it
upon his thumb. One or two dressings will suffice,
as after just tasting the bitter aloes he will take a disgust
to his former enjoyment, and the habit will at
once be broken.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many persons, I know, have an objection to children
sucking their thumbs, as, for instance,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Perhaps it’s as well to keep children from plums,</div>

  </div>

<p class='c008'>My reply is—</p>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>And the mother with joy her still vigil keeps.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>67. <i>A child who is teething dribbles, and thereby
wets his chest, which frequently causes him to catch
cold; what had better be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Have in readiness to put on several <i>flannel</i> dribbling-bibs,
so that they may be changed as often as
they become wet; or, if he dribble <i>very much</i>, the
oiled silk dribbling-bibs, instead of the flannel ones,
may be used, and which may be procured at any baby-linen
warehouse.</p>

<p class='c008'>68. <i>Do you approve of giving a child, during teething,
much fruit?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No; unless it be a few ripe strawberries or raspberries,
or a roasted apple, or the juice of five or six
grapes—taking care that he does not swallow either
the seeds or the skin—or the insides of ripe gooseberries,
or an orange. Such fruits, if the bowels be in a
costive state, will be particularly useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>All stone fruits, <i>raw</i> apples, or pears ought to be
carefully avoided, as they not only disorder the stomach
and the bowels—causing convulsions, gripings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1070'>1070</span>etc.—but they have the effect of weakening the bowels,
and thus of engendering worms.</p>

<p class='c008'>69. <i>Is a child, during teething, more subject to disease,
and if so, to what complaints, and in what manner
may they be prevented?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The teeth are a fruitful source of suffering and of
disease, and are with truth styled “our first and our
last plagues.” Dentition is the most important period
of a child’s life, and is the exciting cause of many infantile
diseases; during this period, therefore, he requires
constant and careful watching. When we consider
how the teeth elongate and enlarge in his gums,
pressing on the nerves and on the surrounding parts,
and thus how frequently they produce pain, irritation,
and inflammation; when we further contemplate what
sympathy there is in the nervous system, and how
susceptible the young are to pain, no surprise can be
felt at the immense disturbance and the consequent
suffering and danger frequently experienced by children
while cutting their <i>first</i> set of teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The complaints or the diseases induced by dentition
are numberless, affecting almost every organ of the
body,—the <i>brain</i>, occasioning convulsions, water on
the brain, etc.; the <i>lungs</i>, producing congestion, inflammation,
cough, etc.; the <i>stomach</i>, exciting sickness,
flatulence, acidity, etc.; the <i>bowels</i>, inducing griping,
at one time costiveness, and at another time purging;
the <i>skin</i>, causing “breakings-out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent these diseases, means ought to be used
to invigorate a child’s constitution by plain, wholesome
food, as recommended under the article of diet; by exercise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1071'>1071</span>and fresh air;<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c014'><sup>[162]</sup></a> by allowing him, weather permitting,
to be out of doors a great part of every day;
by lancing the gums when they get red, hot, and
swollen; by attention to the bowels, and if he suffer
more than usual, by keeping them rather in a relaxed
state by any simple aperient, such as either castor oil
or magnesia and rhubarb, etc.; and, let me add, by
attention to his temper. Many children are made
feverish and ill by petting and spoiling them. On
this subject I cannot do better than refer you to an excellent
little work entitled Abbott’s <i>Mother at Home</i>,
wherein the author proves the great importance of
<i>early</i> training.</p>

<p class='c008'>70. <i>Have the goodness to describe the symptoms and
the treatment of Painful Dentition.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Painful dentition may be divided into two forms—(1.)
the Mild; and (2.) the Severe. In the <i>mild</i> form
the child is peevish and fretful, and puts his fingers,
and everything within reach, to his mouth; he likes to
have his gums rubbed, and takes the breast with
avidity; indeed, it seems a greater comfort to him
than ever. There is generally a considerable flow of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1072'>1072</span>saliva, and he has frequently a more loose state of
bowels than is his wont.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, with regard to the more <i>severe</i> form of painful
dentition: The gums are red, swollen, and hot, and he
cannot, without expressing pain, bear to have them
touched; hence, if he be at the breast, he is constantly
loosing the nipple. There is dryness of the mouth,
although before there had been a great flow of saliva.
He is feverish, restless, and starts in his sleep. His
face is flushed. His head is heavy and hot. He is
sometimes convulsed.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c014'><sup>[163]</sup></a> He is frequently violently
griped and purged, and suffers severely from flatulence.
He is predisposed to many and severe diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>treatment</i> of the <i>mild</i> form consists of friction
of the gums with the finger; with a little “soothing
syrup,” as recommended by Sir Charles Locock;<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a> a
tepid bath of about 92 degrees Fahrenheit, every
night at bedtime; attention to diet and bowels; fresh
air and exercise. For the mild form, the above plan
will usually be all that is required. If he dribble and
the bowels be relaxed, so much the better; the flow of
saliva and the increased action of the bowels afford
relief, and therefore must not be interfered with. In
the <i>mild</i> form lancing of the gums is not desirable.
The gums ought not to be lanced unless the teeth be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1073'>1073</span>near at hand, and unless the gums be red, hot, and
swollen.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>severe</i> form a medical man should be consulted
early, as more energetic remedies will be demanded;
that is to say, the gums will require to be freely lanced,
warm baths to be used, and medicines to be given, to
ward off mischief from the head, from the chest, and
from the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you are living in the town and your baby suffers
much from teething, take him into the country. It is
wonderful what change of air to the country will often
do, in relieving a child, who is painfully cutting his
teeth. The number of deaths in London from teething
is frightful; it is in the country comparatively trifling.</p>

<p class='c008'>71. <i>Should an infant be purged during teething, or
indeed, during any other time, do you approve of
either absorbent or astringent medicines to restrain it?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. I should look upon the relaxation
as an effort of nature to relieve itself. A child is
never purged without a cause; that cause, in the generality
of instances, is the presence of either some undigested
food, or acidity, or depraved motions that
want a vent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The better plan is, in such a case, to give a dose of
aperient medicine, such as either castor oil or magnesia
and rhubarb, and thus work it off. <span class='sc'>If we lock up
the bowels, we confine the enemy, and thus produce
mischief.</span><a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c014'><sup>[165]</sup></a> If he be purged more than usual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1074'>1074</span>attention should be paid to the diet—if it be absolutely
necessary to give him artificial food while suckling—and
care must be taken not to overload the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>72. <i>A child is subject to a slight cough during dentition—called
by nurses “tooth-cough”—which a parent
would not consider of sufficient importance to consult
a doctor about; pray tell me if there is any objection
to a mother giving her child a small quantity either of
syrup of white poppies or of paregoric to ease it?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A cough is an effort of nature to bring up any secretion
from the lining membrane of the lungs, or from
the bronchial tubes, hence it ought not to be interfered
with. I have known the administration of syrup of
white poppies, or of paregoric, to stop the cough, and
thereby to prevent the expulsion of the phlegm, and
thus to produce either inflammation of the lungs or
bronchitis. Moreover, both paregoric and syrup of
white poppies are, for a young child, dangerous medicines
(unless administered by a judicious medical man),
and <i>ought never to be given by a mother</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the month of April, 1844, I was sent for in great
haste to an infant, aged seventeen months, who was
laboring under convulsions and extreme drowsiness,
from the injudicious administration of paregoric, which
had been given to him to ease a cough. By the prompt
administration of an emetic he was saved.</p>

<p class='c008'>73. <i>A child who is teething is subject to a “breaking-out,”
more especially behind the ears—which is
most disfiguring, and frequently very annoying; what
would you recommend?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I would apply no external application to cure it, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1075'>1075</span>I should look upon it as an effort of the constitution
to relieve itself; and should expect, if the “breaking-out”
were repelled, that either convulsions, or bronchitis,
or inflammation of the lungs, or water on the
brain would be the consequence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only plan I should adopt would be, to be more
careful in his diet: to give him less meat (if he be old
enough to eat animal food), and to give him, once or
twice a week, a few doses of mild aperient medicine;
and, if the irritation from the “breaking-out” be great,
to bathe it occasionally either with a little warm milk
and water, or with rose water.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EXERCISE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>74. <i>Do you recommend exercise in the open air for
a baby? and if so, how soon after birth?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I am a great advocate for having exercise in the
open air. “The infant in arms makes known its desire
for fresh air by restlessness—it cries, for it cannot
speak its wants; is taken abroad, and is quiet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The age at which he ought to commence taking exercise
will, of course, depend upon the season and upon
the weather. If it be summer, and the weather be fine,
he should be carried in the open air a week or a fortnight
after birth; but if it be winter, he ought not, on
any account, to be taken out under the month, and not
even then, unless the weather be mild for the season,
and it be the middle of the day. At the end of two
months he should breathe the open air more frequently.
And after the expiration of three months he ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1076'>1076</span>be carried out <i>every day</i>, even if it be wet under foot,
provided it be fine above, and the wind be neither in
an easterly nor in a northeasterly direction; by doing
so we shall make him strong and hearty, and give the
skin that mottled appearance which is so characteristic
of health. He must, of course, be well clothed.</p>

<p class='c008'>I cannot help expressing my disapprobation of the
practice of smothering up an infant’s face with a handkerchief,
with a veil, or with any other covering, when
he is taken out into the air. If his face be so muffled
up, he may as well remain at home; as, under such circumstances,
it is impossible for him to receive any benefit
from the invigorating effects of the fresh air.</p>

<p class='c008'>75. <i>Can you devise any method to induce a baby
himself to take exercise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He must be encouraged to use muscular exertion;
and, for this purpose, he ought to be frequently laid
either upon a rug, or carpet, or the floor: he will then
stretch his limbs and kick about with perfect glee. It is
a pretty sight, to see a little fellow kicking and sprawling
on the floor. He crows with delight, and thoroughly
enjoys himself: it strengthens his back; it enables
him to stretch his limbs, and to use his muscles;
and is one of the best kinds of exercise a very young
child can take. While going through his performances,
his diaper, if he wear one, should be unfastened, in order
that he might go through his exercises untrammeled.
By adopting the above plan, the babe quietly enjoys
himself—his brain is not over-excited by it; this is an
important consideration, for both mothers and nurses
are apt to rouse and excite very young children, to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1077'>1077</span>manifest detriment. A babe requires rest, and not excitement.
How wrong it is, then, for either a mother
or a nurse to be exciting and rousing a new-born babe.
It is most injurious and weakening to his brain. In
the early period of his existence his time ought to be
almost entirely spent in sleeping and in sucking!</p>

<p class='c008'>76. <i>Do you approve of tossing an infant much
about?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I have seen a child tossed up nearly to the ceiling!
Can anything be more cruel or absurd? Violent tossing
of a young babe ought never to be allowed: it only
frightens him, and has been known to bring on convulsions.
He should be gently moved up and down (not
tossed): such exercise causes a proper circulation of the
blood, promotes digestion, and soothes to sleep. He
must always be kept quiet immediately after taking the
breast: if he be tossed <i>directly</i> afterward, it interferes
with his digestion, and is likely to produce sickness.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SLEEP.</h4>

<p class='c018'>77. <i>Ought the infant’s sleeping apartment to be kept
warm?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The lying-in room is generally kept too warm, its
heat being, in many instances, more that of an oven
than of a room. Such a place is must unhealthy, and
is fraught with danger both to the mother and the baby.
We are not, of course, to run into an opposite extreme,
but are to keep the chamber at a moderate and comfortable
temperature. The door ought occasionally to
be left ajar, in order the more effectually to change the
air and thus to make it more pure and sweet.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1078'>1078</span>A new-born babe, then, ought to be kept comfortably
warm, but not very warm. It is folly in the extreme
to attempt to harden a very young child either by
allowing him, in the winter time, to be in a bedroom
without a fire, or by dipping him in <i>cold</i> water, or by
keeping him with scant clothing on his bed. The temperature
of a bedroom, in the winter time, should be,
as nearly as possible, at 60° Fahr. Although the room
should be comfortably warm, it ought, from time to
time, to be properly ventilated. An unventilated room
soon becomes foul, and, therefore, unhealthy. How
many in this world, both children and adults, are
“poisoned with their own breaths!”</p>

<p class='c008'>An infant should not be allowed to look at the glare
either of a fire or of a lighted candle, as the glare tends
to weaken the sight, and sometimes brings on an inflammation
of the eyes. In speaking to and in noticing
a baby, you ought always to stand <i>before</i> and not <i>behind</i>
him, or it might make him squint.</p>

<p class='c008'>78. <i>Ought a babe to lie alone from the first?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. At first—say for the first few months—he
requires the warmth of another person’s body,
especially in the winter; but care must be taken not to
overlay him, as many infants, from carelessness in this
particular, have lost their lives. After the first few
months, he had better lie alone, on a horse-hair mattress.</p>

<p class='c008'>79. <i>Do you approve of rocking an infant to sleep?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do not. If the rules of health be observed, he will
sleep both soundly and sweetly without rocking; if
they be not, the rocking might cause him to fall into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1079'>1079</span>feverish, disturbed slumber, but not into a refreshing,
calm sleep. Besides, if you once take to that habit, he
will not go to sleep without it.</p>

<p class='c008'>80. <i>Then don’t you approve of a rocking-chair, and
of rockers to the cradle?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not: a rocking-chair, or rockers to the
cradle, may be useful to a lazy nurse or mother, and
may induce a child to sleep, but that restlessly, when
he does not need sleep, or when he is wet and uncomfortable,
and requires “changing;” but will not cause
him to have that sweet and gentle and exquisite slumber
so characteristic of a baby who has no artificial appliances
to make him sleep. No! rockers are perfectly
unnecessary, and the sooner they are banished the
nursery the better will it be for the infant community.
I do not know a more wearisome and monotonous
sound than the everlasting rockings to and fro in some
nurseries; they are often accompanied by a dolorous
lullaby from the nurse, which adds much to the misery
and depressing influence of the performance.</p>

<p class='c008'>81. <i>While the infant is asleep, do you advise the head
of the crib to be covered with a handkerchief, to shade
his eyes from the light, and, if it be summer time, to
keep off the flies?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If the head of the crib be covered, the baby cannot
breathe freely; the air within the crib becomes contaminated,
and thus the lungs cannot properly perform
their functions. If his sleep is to be refreshing, he
must breathe pure air. I do not even approve of a head
to a crib. A child is frequently allowed to sleep on a
bed with the curtains drawn completely close, as though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1080'>1080</span>it were dangerous for a breath of air to blow upon him!<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c014'><sup>[166]</sup></a>
This practice is most injurious. An infant must have
the full benefit of the air of the room; indeed, the bedroom
door ought to be frequently left ajar, so that the
air of the apartment may be changed—taking care, of
course, not to expose him to a draught. If the flies,
while he is asleep, annoy him, let a <i>net</i> veil be thrown
over his face, as he can readily breathe through net,
but not through a handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c008'>82. <i>Have you any suggestions to offer as to the way
a babe should be dressed when he is put down to sleep?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever he be put down to sleep, be more than
usually particular that his dress be loose in every part;
be careful that there be neither strings nor bands to
cramp him. Let him, then, during repose, be more
than ordinarily free and unrestrained—</p>

      <div class='line'>“If, while in cradled rest your infant sleeps,</div>
      <div class='line'>Your watchful eye unceasing vigils keeps,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>83. <i>Is it a good sign for a young child to sleep much?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A babe who sleeps a great deal thrives much more
than one who does not. I have known many children
who were born<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c014'><sup>[168]</sup></a> small and delicate, but who slept the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1081'>1081</span>greatest part of their time, become strong and healthy.
On the other hand, I have known those who were born
large and strong, yet who slept but little, become weak
and unhealthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common practice of a nurse allowing a baby to
sleep upon her lap is a bad one, and ought never to be
countenanced. He sleeps cooler, more comfortably,
and soundly in his crib.</p>

<p class='c008'>The younger an infant is the more he generally sleeps,
so that during the early months he is seldom awake,
and then only to take the breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>84. <i>How is it that much sleep causes a young child
to thrive so well?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1082'>1082</span>If there be pain in any part of the body, or if any of
the functions be not properly performed, he sleeps but
little. On the contrary, if there be exemption from
pain, and if there be a due performance of all the functions,
he sleeps a great deal; and thus the body becomes
refreshed and invigorated.</p>

<p class='c008'>85. <i>As much sleep is of such advantage, if an infant
sleep but little, would you advise composing medicine
to be given to him?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. The practice of giving composing
medicine to a young child cannot be too strongly reprobated.
If he does not sleep enough, the mother ought
to ascertain if the bowels be in a proper state, whether
they be sufficiently opened that the motions be of a good
color—namely, a bright yellow, inclining to orange
color—and free from slime or from bad smell. An
occasional dose of rhubarb and magnesia is frequently
the best composing medicine he can take.</p>

<p class='c008'>86. <i>We often hear of Coroner’s inquests upon infants
who have been found dead in bed—accidentally
overlaid: what is usually the cause?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Suffocation, produced either by ignorance or by carelessness.
From <i>ignorance</i> in mothers, in their not
knowing the common laws of life, and the vital importance
of free and unrestricted respiration, not only when
babies are up and about, but when they are in bed and
asleep. From <i>carelessness</i>, in their allowing young
and thoughtless servants to have the charge of infants
at night; more especially as young girls are usually
heavy sleepers, and are thus too much overpowered
with sleep to attend to their necessary duties.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1083'>1083</span>A foolish mother sometimes goes to sleep while allowing
her child to continue sucking. The unconscious
babe, after a time, looses the nipple, and buries his head
in the bedclothes. She awakes in the morning, finding,
to her horror, a corpse by her side! A mother ought,
therefore, never to go to sleep until her child has
finished sucking.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The following are a few rules to prevent an infant
from being accidentally overlaid</i>: (1.) Let your baby,
while asleep, have plenty of room in the bed. (2.) Do
not allow him to be too near to you; or if he be unavoidably
near you (from the small size of the bed), let
his face be turned to the opposite side. (3.) Let him
lie fairly either on his side or on his back. (4.) Be
careful to ascertain that his mouth be not covered with
the bedclothes; and (5.) Do not smother his face with
clothes, as a plentiful supply of pure air is as necessary
when he is awake, or even more so, than when he is
asleep. (6.) Never let him lie low in the bed. (7.)
Let there be <i>no</i> pillow near the one his head is resting
on, lest he roll to it, and thus bury his head in it. Remember,
a young child has neither the strength nor the
sense to get out of danger; and, if he unfortunately
either turn on his face, or bury his head in a pillow that
is near, the chances are that he will be suffocated, more
especially as these accidents usually occur at night,
when the mother or the nurse is fast asleep. (8.)
Never intrust him at night to a young, giddy, and
thoughtless servant.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'>THE BLADDER AND THE BOWELS OF AN INFANT.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>87. <i>Have you any hints to offer respecting the bowels
and the bladder of an infant during the first three
months of his existence?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A mother ought daily to satisfy herself as to the state
of the bladder and the bowels of her child. She herself
should inspect the motions, and see that they are of a
proper color (bright yellow, inclining to orange) and
consistence (that of thick gruel), that they are neither
slimy, nor curdled, nor green; if they should be either
the one or the other, it is a proof that she herself has,
in all probability, been imprudent in her diet, and that
it will be necessary for the future that she be more
careful both in what she eats and in what she drinks.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ought, moreover, to satisfy herself that the urine
does not smell strongly, that it does not stain the
napkins, and that he makes a sufficient quantity.</p>

<p class='c008'>A frequent cause of a child crying is, he is wet and
uncomfortable, and wants drying and changing, and
the only way he has of informing his mother of the
fact is by crying lustily, and thus telling her in most
expressive language of her thoughtlessness and carelessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>88. <i>How soon may an infant dispense with napkins?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A baby of three months and upward, ought to be
held out at least a dozen times during the twenty-four
hours; if such a plan were adopted, napkins might at
the end of three months be dispensed with—a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1085'>1085</span><i>desideratum</i>—and he would be inducted into clean
habits—a blessing to himself, and a comfort to all
around, and a great saving of dresses and of furniture.
“Teach your children to be clean. A dirty child is
the mother’s disgrace.”<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c014'><sup>[169]</sup></a> Truer words were never
written: <span class='sc'>A dirty child is the mother’s disgrace!</span></p>

<h4 class='c017'>AILMENTS, DISEASE, <span class='sc'>Etc.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>89. <i>A new-born babe frequently has a collection of
mucus in the air-passages, causing him to wheeze: is
it a dangerous symptom?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No, not if it occur <i>immediately</i> after birth; as soon
as the bowels have been opened, it generally leaves him,
or even before, if he give a good cry, which as soon as
he is born he usually does. If there be any mucus
either within or about the mouth, impeding breathing,
it must with a soft handkerchief be removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>90. <i>Is it advisable, as soon as an infant is born, to
give him medicine?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is now proved that the giving of medicine to a
babe <i>immediately</i> after birth is unnecessary, nay, that it
is hurtful—that is, provided he be early put to the
breast, as the mother’s <i>first</i> milk is generally sufficient
to open the bowels. Sir Charles Locock<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c014'><sup>[170]</sup></a> makes the
following sensible remarks on the subject: “I used to
limit any aperient to a new-born infant to those which
had not the first milk, and who had wet-nurses whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1086'>1086</span>milk was, of course, some weeks old; but for many years,
I have never allowed any aperient at all to any new-born
infant, and I am satisfied it is the safest and the
wisest plan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This advice of Sir Charles Locock—<i>to give no aperient
to a new-born infant</i>—is most valuable, and ought
to be strictly followed. By adopting his recommendation
much after-misery might be averted. If a new-born
babe’s bowels be costive, rather than give him an
aperient, try the effect of a little moist sugar dissolved
in a little water; that is to say, dissolve half a teaspoonful
of pure unadulterated <i>raw</i> sugar in a teaspoonful
of warm water, and administer it to him; if
in four hours it should not operate, repeat the dose.
Butter and raw sugar is a popular remedy, and is sometimes
used by a nurse to open the bowels of a new-born
babe, and where there is costiveness answers the
purpose exceedingly well, and is far superior to castor
oil. Try by all means to do, if possible, without a particle
of opening medicine. If you once begin to give
aperients, you will have frequently to repeat them.
Opening physic leads to opening physic, until at length
his stomach and bowels will become a physic shop!
Let me, then, emphatically say, avoid, if possible,
giving a new-born babe a drop or a grain of opening
medicine. If from the first you refrain from giving an
aperient, he seldom requires one afterward. It is the
<i>first</i> step that is so important to take in this as in all
other things.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a new-born babe has <i>not</i> for twelve hours made
water, the medical man ought to be informed of it, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1087'>1087</span>order that he may inquire into the matter and apply
the proper remedies. Be particular in attending to
these directions, or evil consequences will inevitably
ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>91. <i>Some persons say that new-born female infants
have milk in their bosoms, and that it is necessary to
squeeze them, and apply plasters to disperse the milk.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The idea of there being real milk in a baby’s breast
is doubtful, the squeezing of the bosom is barbarous,
and the application of plasters is useless. “Without
actually saying,” says Sir Charles Locock, “there is
milk secreted in the breasts of infants, there is undoubtedly
not rarely considerable swelling of the breasts
both in <i>female</i> and <i>male</i> infants, and on squeezing
them a serous fluid oozes out. I agree with you that
the nurses should never be allowed to squeeze them,
but be ordered to leave them alone.”<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c014'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>92. <i>Have the goodness to mention the</i> <span class='fss'>SLIGHT</span> <i>ailments
which are not of sufficient importance to demand
the assistance of a medical man?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I deem it well to make the distinction between <i>serious</i>
and <i>slight</i> ailments; I am addressing a mother.
With regard to <i>serious</i> ailments, I do not think myself
justified, except in certain <i>urgent</i> cases, in instructing
a parent to deal with them. It might be well to make
a mother acquainted with the <i>symptoms</i>, but not with
the <i>treatment</i>, in order that she might lose no time in
calling in medical aid. This I hope to have the pleasure
of doing in future conversations.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1088'>1088</span><i>Serious</i> diseases, <i>with a few exceptions</i>, and which I
will indicate in subsequent conversations, ought never
to be treated by a parent, not even in the <i>early</i> stages,
for it is in the early stages that the most good can
generally be done. It is utterly impossible for any one
who is not trained to the medical profession to understand
a <i>serious</i> disease in all its bearings, and thereby
to treat it satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are some exceptions to these remarks. It will
be seen, in future conversations, that Sir Charles Locock
considers that a mother ought to be made acquainted
with the <i>treatment</i> of <i>some</i> of the more <i>serious</i> diseases,
where delay in obtaining <i>immediate</i> medical
assistance might be death. I bow to his superior judgment,
and have supplied the deficiency in subsequent
conversations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ailments and the diseases of infants, such as
may, in the absence of the doctor, be treated by a parent,
are the following: Chafings, Convulsions, Costiveness,
Flatulence, Gripings, Hiccup, Looseness of the
Bowels (Diarrhœa), Dysentery, Nettle-rash, Red-gum,
Stuffing of the Nose, Sickness, Thrush. In all these
complaints I will tell you—<i>What to do</i>, and—<i>What</i>
<span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>93. <i>What are the causes and the treatment of chafing?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The want of water: inattention and want of cleanliness
are the usual causes of chafing.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—The chafed parts ought to be well and
thoroughly sponged with tepid <i>rain</i> water—allowing
the water from a well-filled sponge to stream over
them—and, afterward, they should be thoroughly but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1089'>1089</span>tenderly dried with a soft towel, and then be dusted,
either with finely-powdered starch made of wheaten
flour, or with violet powder, or with finely-powdered
native carbonate of zinc, or they should be bathed
with finely-powdered fuller’s-earth and tepid water.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, in a few days, the parts be not healed, discontinue
the above treatment, and use the following application:
Beat up well together the whites of two eggs,
then add, drop by drop, two tablespoonfuls of brandy.
When well mixed put it into a bottle and cork it up.
Before using it let the excoriated parts be gently bathed
with lukewarm rain water, and, with a soft napkin, be
tenderly dried; then, by means of a camel’s-hair brush,
apply the above liniment, having first shaken the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>But bear in mind, after all that can be said and done,
<i>that there is nothing in these cases like water</i>—there is
nothing like keeping the parts clean, and the only way
of <i>thoroughly</i> effecting this object is <i>by putting him
every morning</i> <span class='fss'>INTO</span> <i>his tub</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not apply white lead, as it is a
poison. Do not be afraid of using <i>plenty</i> of water, as
cleanliness is one of the most important items of the
treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>94. <i>What are the causes of convulsions in an infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Stuffing him, in the early months of his existence,
<i>with food</i>, the mother having plenty of breast-milk the
while; the constant physicking of a child by his own
mother; teething; hooping-cough, when attacking a
very young baby.</p>

<p class='c008'>I never knew a case of convulsions occur—say for
the first four months (except in very young infants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1090'>1090</span>laboring under hooping-cough)—where children lived
on the breast-milk alone, and where they were <i>not</i> frequently
quacked by their mothers!</p>

<p class='c008'>For the treatment of the convulsions from teething,
see page <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do</i> in a case of convulsions which has been
caused by feeding an infant either with too much or
with <i>artificial</i> food. Give him, every ten minutes, a
teaspoonful of ipecacuanha wine, until free vomiting
be excited, then put him into a warm bath (see Warm
Baths); and when he comes out of it administer to him
a teaspoonful of castor oil, and repeat it every four
hours until the bowels be well opened.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not, for at least a month after
the fit, give him artificial food, but keep him entirely
to the breast. Do not apply leeches to the head.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do in a case of convulsions from hooping-cough.</i>—There
is nothing better than dashing cold water
on the face, and immersing him in a warm bath of 98
degrees Fahr. If he be about his teeth, and they be
plaguing him, let the gums be both freely and frequently
lanced. In convulsions from hooping-cough I
have found cod-liver oil a valuable medicine. Convulsions
seldom occur in hooping-cough, unless the child
be either very young or exceedingly delicate. In either
case cod-liver oil is likely to be serviceable, as it helps
to sustain and support him in his extremity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Convulsions attending an attack of hooping-cough
make it a <i>serious</i> complication, and requires the assiduous
and skillful attention of a judicious medical
man.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1091'>1091</span><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i> in such a case.—Do not apply
leeches; the babe requires additional strength, and not
to be robbed of it; and do not attempt to treat the
case yourself.</p>

<p class='c008'>95. <i>What are the best remedies for the costiveness
of an infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I strongly object to the frequent administration of
opening medicine, as the repetition of it increases the
mischief to a tenfold degree.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—If a babe, after the first few months,
were held out, and if, at regular intervals, he were put
upon his chair, costiveness would not so much prevail.
It is wonderful how soon the bowels, in the generality
of cases, by this simple plan may be brought into a
regular state.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides, it inducts an infant into clean habits. I
know many careful mothers who have accustomed their
children, after the first three months, to do without
diapers altogether. It causes at first a little trouble,
but that trouble is amply repaid by the good consequences
that ensue; among which must be named the
dispensing with such incumbrances as diapers. Diapers
frequently chafe, irritate, and gall the tender skin of a
baby. But they cannot, of course, at an early age be
dispensed with, unless a mother has great judgment,
sense, tact, and perseverance, to bring her little charge
into the habit of having the bowels relieved and the
bladder emptied every time he is either held out or put
upon his chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before giving an infant a particle of aperient medicine,
try, if the bowels are costive, the effect of a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1092'>1092</span>raw sugar and water, either half a teaspoonful of raw
sugar dissolved in a teaspoonful or two of water, or
give him, out of your fingers, half a teaspoonful of raw
sugar to eat. I mean by <i>raw</i> sugar, not the white, but
the pure and unadulterated sugar, and which you can
only procure from a respectable grocer. If you are
wise, you will defer as long as you can giving an
aperient. If you once begin, and continue it for awhile,
opening medicine becomes a dire necessity, and then
woe-betide the poor unfortunate child!</p>

<p class='c008'>It might sometimes be necessary to give opening
medicine, but the less frequently the better. The following,
when it becomes absolutely necessary to give an
aperient, are some of the best, simple, and safe that can
be administered by a mother to her baby. I give you
several, as it might be well, from time to time, to vary
them: (1.) One or two teaspoonfuls of fluid magnesia,
made palatable by the addition of a little sugar, may be
chosen; or (2.) The popular remedy of syrup of rhubarb
and castor oil:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Syrup of Rhubarb,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Castor Oil, of each half an ounce:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. A teaspoonful to be taken early in the morning,
first well shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might be well again to state, that the bottle must be
<i>violently</i> shaken <i>just</i> before administering the mixture,
or the oil will not mix with the syrup; or (3.) A teaspoonful
of syrup of rhubarb, without the admixture of
the castor oil may be given early in the morning occasionally;
or (4.) A teaspoonful of equal parts, say half
an ounce of each, of fluid magnesia and of syrup of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1093'>1093</span>rhubarb, may be taken for a change. Another safe
and palatable aperient for an infant is (5.) Syrup of
senna, from a half to a whole teaspoonful being the
dose. Castor oil is another medicine prescribed for a
baby’s costiveness, and, being a safe one, may occasionally
be used. Care should be taken to have the
castor oil freshly drawn, and of the best quality. (6.)
Syrup of red roses and castor oil (of each equal parts),
being a good, elegant, and pleasant way of giving it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Syrup of Red Roses,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Castor Oil, of each six drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. A teaspoonful to be taken occasionally, first
well shaking the bottle, and to be repeated every four hours, until
the bowels be relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>(7.) An excellent remedy for the costiveness of a baby
is a soap suppository, the application of which will be
found a safe, speedy, and certain method of opening the
bowels. It is made by paring a piece of white curd-soap
round; it should be of the size, in circumference, of a
cedar pencil, and it must be in length about two inches.
This should be administered by dipping it in a little
warm sweet oil, and should then be gently introduced
up the bowel in the same manner as you would an
enema pipe, allowing about a quarter of an inch to remain
in view. It must then be left alone, and in a
minute or two the soap suppository will be expelled,
and instantly the bowels will be comfortably and effectually
relieved. When a child is two or three years old
and upwards a dip-candle suppository is superior to a
soap suppository.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1094'>1094</span>If it be <i>absolutely</i> necessary to give opening medicine,
it will be well to alternate the use of them—that
is to say, to give at one time the syrup of senna, at
another the fluid magnesia sweetened, and a third to
administer the soap suppository dipped in oil, but
waiting at least two days between, the bowels being
costive all the time, before resorting to an aperient.
Bear in mind, and let it make a strong impression
upon you, that the less the bowels of an infant are
irritated by opening medicine, the aperient being ever
so simple and well-selected, the better will it be for
him both now and for the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the infant is five or six months old, either
oatmeal milk gruel, or Robinson’s Patent Groat Gruel
made with new milk, occasionally given in lieu of the
usual food, will often open the bowels, and will thus
supersede the necessity of administering an aperient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Castor oil, or Dr. Merriman’s Purgative Liniment,<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c014'><sup>[172]</sup></a>
well rubbed every morning, for ten minutes at a time,
over the region of the bowels, will frequently prevent
costiveness, and thus will do away with the need—which
is a great consideration—of giving an aperient.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—There are two preparations of
mercury I wish to warn you against administering of
your own accord, viz.—(1.) Calomel, and a milder
preparation called (2.) gray powder (mercury with
chalk). It is a common practice in this country to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1095'>1095</span>give calomel, on account of the readiness with which
it may be administered, it being small in quantity and
nearly tasteless. Gray powder, also, is, with many
mothers, a favorite in the nursery. It is a medicine of
immense power—either for good or for evil; in certain
cases it is very valuable; but in others, and in the
great majority, it is very detrimental.</p>

<p class='c008'>This practice, then, of a mother giving mercury,
whether in the form either of calomel or of gray powder,
cannot be too strongly reprobated, as the frequent
administration either of one or of the other weakens
the body, predisposes it to cold, and frequently excites
king’s evil—a disease too common in this country.
Calomel and gray powder, then, ought never to be administered
unless ordered by a medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Syrup of buckthorn and jalap are also frequently
given, but they are griping medicines for a baby, and
ought to be banished from the nursery.</p>

<p class='c008'>The frequent repetition of opening medicines, then,
in any shape or form, very much interferes with digestion;
they must, therefore, be given as seldom as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me, at the risk of wearying you, again urge the
importance of your avoiding, as much as possible,
giving a babe purgative medicines. They irritate
beyond measure the tender bowels of an infant, and
only make him more costive afterward; they interfere
with his digestion, and are liable to give him cold. A
mother who is always of her own accord quacking her
child with opening physic, is laying up for her unfortunate
offspring a debilitated constitution—a miserable
existence.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1096'>1096</span>96. <i>Are there any means of preventing the Costiveness
of an infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If greater care were paid to the rules of health,
such as attention to diet, exercise in the open air,
thorough ablution of the <i>whole</i> body—more especially
when he is being washed—causing the water, from a
large and well-filled sponge, to stream over the lower
part of his bowels; the regular habit of causing him,
at stated periods, to be held out, whether he want or
not, that he may solicit a stool. If all these rules
were observed, costiveness would not so frequently
prevail, and one of the miseries of the nursery would
be done away with.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some mothers are frequently dosing their poor unfortunate
babies either with magnesia to cool them, or
with castor oil to heal the bowels! Oh, the folly of such
practices! The frequent repetition of magnesia, instead
of cooling an infant, makes him feverish and irritable.
The constant administration of castor oil, instead of
healing the bowels, wounds them beyond measure. No!
it would be a blessed thing if a baby could be brought
up without giving him a particle of opening medicine;
his bowels would then act naturally and well: but then,
as I have just now remarked, a mother must be particular
in attending to Nature’s medicines—to fresh air,
to exercise, to diet, to thorough ablution, etc. Until
that time comes, poor unfortunate babies must be occasionally
dosed with an aperient.</p>

<p class='c008'>97. <i>What are the causes of, and remedies for, Flatulence?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Flatulence most frequently occurs in those infants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1097'>1097</span>who live on <i>artificial</i> food, especially if they are overfed.
I therefore beg to refer you to the precautions I
have given, when speaking of the importance of keeping
a child for the first four or five months <i>entirely</i> to
the breast; and, if that be not practicable, of the times
of feeding, and of the <i>best</i> kinds of artificial food, and
of those which are least likely to cause “wind.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—Notwithstanding these precautions, if
the babe should still suffer, “One of the best and safest
remedies for flatulence is sal-volatile,—a teaspoonful
of a solution of one drachm to an ounce and a half of
water.”<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c014'><sup>[173]</sup></a> Or, a little dill or aniseed may be added to
the food—half a teaspoonful of dill water. Or, take
twelve drops of oil of dill, and two lumps of sugar; rub
them well in a mortar together; then add, drop by
drop, three tablespoonfuls of spring water; let it be
preserved in a bottle for use. A teaspoonful of this,
first shaking the vial, may be added to each quantity
of food. Or, three teaspoonfuls of bruised caraway seeds
may be boiled for ten minutes in a teacupful of water,
and then strained. One or two teaspoonfuls of the
caraway-tea may be added to each quantity of his food,
or a dose of rhubarb and magnesia may be occasionally
given.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opodeldoc, or warm olive oil, well rubbed, for a
quarter of an hour at a time, by means of the warm
hand, over the bowels, will frequently give relief.
Turning the child over on his bowels, so that they may
press on the nurse’s lap, will often afford great comfort.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1098'>1098</span>A warm bath (where he is suffering severely) generally
gives <i>immediate</i> ease in flatulence; it acts as a fomentation
to the bowels. But after all, a dose of mild aperient
medicine, when the babe is suffering severely, is
often the best remedy for “wind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember, at all times, prevention, whenever it be—and
how frequently it is—possible, is better than cure.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—“Godfrey’s Cordial,” “Infants’
Preservative,” and “Dalby’s Carminative” are sometimes
given in flatulence; but as most of these quack
medicines contain, in one form or another, either opium
or poppy, and as opium and poppy are both dangerous
remedies for children, <span class='fss'>ALL</span> quack medicines must be
banished the nursery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Syrup of poppies is another remedy which is often
given by a nurse to afford relief for flatulence; but let
me urge upon you the importance of banishing it from
the nursery. It has (when given by unprofessional
persons) caused the untimely end of thousands of children.
The medical journals and the newspapers teem
with cases of deaths from mothers incautiously giving
syrup of poppies to ease pain and to procure sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>98. <i>What are the symptoms, the causes, and the treatment
of “Gripings” of an infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>The symptoms.</i>—The child draws up his legs; screams
violently; if put to the nipple to comfort him, he turns
away from it and cries bitterly; he strains, as though
he were having a stool; if he have a motion, it will be
slimy, curdled, and perhaps green. If, in addition to
the above symptoms, he pass a large quantity of watery
fluid from the bowels, the case becomes one of <i>watery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1099'>1099</span>gripes</i>, and requires the immediate attention of a medical
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>causes</i> of “gripings” or “gripes” may proceed
either from the infant or from the mother. If from the
child, it is generally owing either to improper food or to
over-feeding: if from the mother, it may be traced to
her having taken either greens, or pork, or tart beer, or
sour porter, or pickles, or drastic purgatives.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—The <i>treatment</i>, of course, must depend
upon the cause. If it arise from over-feeding, I would
advise a dose of castor oil to be given, and warm fomentations
to be applied to the bowels, and the mother or
the nurse to be more careful for the future. If it proceed
from improper food, a dose or two of magnesia and
rhubarb in a little dill water, made palatable with simple
syrup.<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c014'><sup>[174]</sup></a> If it arise from a mother’s imprudence in
eating trash, or from her taking violent medicine, a
warm bath: a warm bath, indeed, let the cause of
“griping” be what it may, usually affords instant relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another excellent remedy is the following: Soak a
piece of new flannel, folded into two or three thicknesses,
in warm water; wring it tolerably dry, and apply as
hot as the child can comfortably bear it to the bowels,
then wrap him in a warm, dry blanket, and keep him,
for at least half an hour, enveloped in it. Under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1100'>1100</span>above treatment, he will generally soon fall into a sweet
sleep, and awake quite refreshed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not give opiates, astringents,
chalk, or any quack medicine whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a child suffer from a mother’s folly in her eating
improper food, it will be cruel in the extreme for him a
<i>second</i> time to be tormented from the same cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>99. <i>What occasions Hiccough, and what is its treatment?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Hiccough is of such a trifling nature as hardly to require
interference. It may generally be traced to over-feeding.
Should it be severe, four or five grains of calcined
magnesia, with a little syrup and aniseed water,
and attention to feeding, are all that will be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>100. <i>Will you describe the symptoms of Diarrhœa—“Looseness
of the bowels?”</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It will be well, before doing so, to tell you how many
motions a young infant ought to have a day, their color,
consistence, and smell. Well, then, he should have
from three to six motions in the twenty-four hours; the
color ought to be a bright yellow, inclining to orange;
the consistence should be that of thick gruel; indeed,
his motion, if healthy, ought to be somewhat of the
color (but a little more orange-tinted) and of the consistence
of mustard made for the table; it should be
nearly, if not quite, devoid of smell; it ought to have a
faint and peculiar, but not a strong disagreeable odor.
If it has a strong and disagreeable smell, the child is
not well, and the case should be investigated, more
especially if there be either curds or lumps in the motions;
these latter symptoms denote that the food has
not been properly digested.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1101'>1101</span>Now, suppose a child should have a slight bowel
complaint—that is to say, that he has six or eight motions
during the twenty-four hours,—and that the stools
are of a thinner consistence than what I have described,—provided,
at the same time, that he is not griped,
that he has no pain, and has not lost his desire for the
breast: What ought to be done? <i>Nothing.</i> A slight
looseness of the bowels should <i>never</i> be interfered with,—it
is often an effort of nature to relieve itself of some
vitiated motion that wanted a vent—or to act as a diversion,
by relieving the irritation of the gums. Even
if he be not cutting his teeth, he may be “breeding”
them, that is to say, the teeth may be forming in his
gums, and may cause almost as much irritation as
though he were actually cutting them. Hence, you
see the immense good a slight “looseness of the bowels”
may cause. I think that I have now proved to you
the danger of interfering in such a case, and that I have
shown you the folly and the mischief of at once giving
astringents—such as Godfrey’s Cordial, Dalby’s Carminative,
etc.—to relieve a <i>slight</i> relaxation.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moderate “looseness of the bowels,” then, is often
a safety-valve, and you may with as much propriety
close the safety-valve of a steam engine as stop a moderate
“looseness of the bowels!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, if the infant, instead of having from three to
six motions, should have more than double the latter
number; if they be more watery; if they become slimy
and green, or green in part and curdled; if they should
have an unpleasant smell; if he be sick, cross, restless,
fidgety, and poorly; if every time he has a motion he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1102'>1102</span>be griped and in pain, we should then say that he is
laboring under diarrhœa; then, it will be necessary to
give a little medicine, which I will indicate in a subsequent
Conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should there be both blood and slime mixed with the
stool, the case becomes more serious; still, with proper
care, relief can generally be quickly obtained. If the
evacuations—instead of being stool—are merely blood
and slime, and the child strain frequently and violently,
endeavoring thus, but in vain, to relieve himself, crying
at each effort, the case assumes the character of dysentery.<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c014'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>If there be a mixture of blood, slime, and stool from
the bowels, the case would be called dysenteric diarrhœa.
This latter case requires great skill and judgment
on the part of a medical man, and great attention
and implicit obedience from the mother and the nurse.
I merely mention these diseases in order to warn you
of their importance, and of the necessity of strictly attending
to a doctor’s orders.</p>

<p class='c008'>101. <i>What are the causes of Diarrhœa—“Looseness
of the bowels?”</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Improper food; over-feeding; teething; cold; the
mother’s milk from various causes disagreeing, namely,
from her being out of health, from her eating unsuitable
food, from her taking improper and drastic purgatives,
or from her suckling her child when she is pregnant.
Of course, if any of these causes are in operation, they
ought, if possible, to be remedied, or medicine to the
babe will be of little avail.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1103'>1103</span>102. <i>What is the treatment of Diarrhœa?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—If the case be <i>slight</i>, and has lasted
two or three days (do not interfere by giving medicine
at first), and if the cause, as it probably is, be some
acidity or vitiated stool that wants a vent, and thus endeavors
to obtain one by purging, the best treatment
is to assist nature by giving either a dose of castor oil
or a moderate one of rhubarb and magnesia,<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c014'><sup>[176]</sup></a> and thus
to work off the enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the enemy has been worked off, either by the
castor oil or by the magnesia and rhubarb, the purging
will, in all probability, cease; but if the relaxation still
continue, that is to say, for three or four days,—then,
if medical advice cannot be procured, the following
mixture should be given:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Compound Powdered Chalk with Opium, ten grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Oil of Dill, five drops;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, nine drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Make a Mixture.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c014'><sup>[177]</sup></a> Half a teaspoonful to be given to an infant
of six months and under, and one teaspoonful to a child above that
age, every four hours—first shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The baby ought, for a few days, to be kept <i>entirely</i>
to the breast. The mother should be most particular
in her own diet.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—The mother must neither take
greens, nor cabbage, nor raw fruit, nor pastry, nor beer;
indeed, while the diarrhœa of her babe continues, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1104'>1104</span>had better abstain from wine, as well as from fermented
liquors. The child, if at the breast, ought <i>not</i>, while
the diarrhœa continues, to have any artificial food. He
must neither be dosed with gray powder (a favorite
but highly improper remedy in these cases), nor with
any quack medicines, such as Dalby’s Carminative or
Godfrey’s Cordial.</p>

<p class='c008'>103. <i>What are the symptoms of Dysentery?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Dysentery frequently arises from a neglected diarrhœa.
It is more dangerous than diarrhœa, as it is of
an inflammatory character; and as, unfortunately, it
frequently attacks a delicate child, requires skillful handling:
hence the care and experience required in treating
a case of dysentery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, then, what are the symptoms? The infant, in
all probability, has had an attack of diarrhœa—bowel
complaint as it is called—for several days; he having
had a dozen or two of motions, many of them slimy
and frothy, like “frog-spawn,” during the twenty-four
hours. Suddenly the character of the motion changes,—from
being principally stool, it becomes almost entirely
blood and mucus; he is dreadfully griped, which causes
him to strain violently, as though his inside would
come away every time he has a motion,—screaming
and twisting about, evidently being in the greatest
pain, drawing his legs up to his belly and writhing in
agony. Sickness and vomiting are always present,
which still more robs him of his little remaining
strength, and prevents the repair of his system. Now,
look at his face! It is the very picture of distress.
Suppose he has been a plump, healthy little fellow, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1105'>1105</span>will see his face, in a few days, become old-looking,
care-worn, haggard, and pinched. Day and night the
enemy tracks him (unless proper remedies be administered);
no sleep, or, if he sleep, he is every few minutes
roused. It is heart-rending to have to attend a
bad case of dysentery in a child,—the writhing, the
screaming, the frequent vomiting, the pitiful look, the
rapid wasting and exhaustion, make it more distressing
to witness than almost any other disease a doctor attends.</p>

<p class='c008'>104. <i>Can anything be done to relieve such a case?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Yes. A judicious medical man will do a great deal.
But, suppose that you are not able to procure one, I
will tell you <i>what to do</i> and <i>what</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—If the child be at the breast, keep him
to it, and let him have nothing else, for dysentery is
frequently caused by improper feeding. If your milk
be not good, or it be scanty, <i>instantly</i> procure a healthy
wet-nurse. <i>Lose not a moment</i>; for in dysentery
moments are precious. But, suppose that you have no
milk, and that no wet-nurse can be procured: what
then? Feed him entirely on cow’s milk—the milk of
<i>one</i> healthy cow; let the milk be unboiled, and be fresh
from the cow. Give it in small quantities at a time,
and frequently, so that it may be retained on the
stomach. If a tablespoonful of the milk make him
sick, give him a dessertspoonful; if a dessertspoonful
cause sickness, let him only have a teaspoonful at a
time, and let it be repeated every quarter of an hour.
But remember, in such a case the breast-milk—the
breast milk alone—is incomparably superior to any
other milk or to any other food whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1106'>1106</span>If he be a year old and weaned, then feed him, as
above recommended, on the cow’s milk. If there be
extreme exhaustion and debility, let fifteen drops of
brandy be added to each tablespoonful of new milk,
and let it be given every half hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now with regard to medicine. I approach this part
of the treatment with some degree of reluctance—for
dysentery is a case requiring opium, and opium I never
like a mother of her own accord to administer. But
suppose a medical man cannot be procured in time, the
mother must then prescribe or the child will die! <i>What
then is to be done?</i> Sir Charles Locock considers “that
in severe dysentery, especially where there is sickness,
there is no remedy equal to pure calomel, in a full dose,
without opium.”<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c014'><sup>[178]</sup></a> Therefore, at the very <i>onset</i> of the
disease, let from three to five grains (according to the
age of the patient) of calomel, mixed with an equal
quantity of powdered white sugar, be put dry on the
tongue. In three hours after let the following mixture
be administered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Compound Ipecacuanha Powder, five grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Ipecacuanha Wine, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Cinnamon Water, nine drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture.<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c014'><sup>[179]</sup></a> A teaspoonful to be given every three or
four hours, first <i>well</i> shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Supposing he cannot retain the mixture—the stomach
rejecting it as soon as swallowed—what then?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1107'>1107</span>Give the opium, mixed with small doses of mercury
with chalk and sugar, in the form of powder, and put
one of the powders <i>dry</i> on the tongue every three
hours:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powdered Opium, half a grain;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Mercury with Chalk, nine grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Sugar of Milk, twenty-four grains:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix well in a mortar, and divide into twelve powders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, suppose the dysentery has for several days
persisted, and that, during that time, nothing but
mucus and blood—that no real stool—has come from
the bowels, then a combination of castor oil and
opium<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c014'><sup>[180]</sup></a> ought, instead of the medicine recommended
above, to be given.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Mixture of Acacia, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Tincture of Opium, ten drops (<i>not</i> minims);</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Castor Oil, two drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Cinnamon Water, four drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Make a Mixture. A teaspoonful to be taken every four hours, first
<i>well</i> shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>A warm bath, at the commencement of the disease,
is very efficacious; but it must be given at the <i>commencement</i>.
If he has had dysentery for a day or
two, he will be too weak to have a warm bath; then,
instead of the bath, try the following: Wrap him in a
blanket which has been previously wrung out of hot
water, over which envelop him in a <i>dry</i> blanket.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1108'>1108</span>Keep him in this hot, damp blanket for half an hour;
then take him out, put on his night-gown and place
him in bed, which has been, if it be winter time, previously
warmed. The above “blanket treatment” will
frequently give great relief, and will sometimes cause
him to fall into a sweet sleep. A flannel bag filled
with hot powdered table salt, made hot in the oven,
applied to the bowels, will afford much comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not give aperients, unless it
be, as before advised, the castor oil guarded with the
opium; do not stuff him with artificial food; do not
fail to send for a judicious and an experienced medical
man; for, remember, it requires a skillful doctor to
treat a case of dysentery, more especially in a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>105. <i>What are the symptoms, the causes, and the
treatment of Nettle-rash?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Nettle-rash consists of several irregular raised
wheals, red at the base and white on the summit, on different
parts of the body; <i>but it seldom attacks the face</i>.
It is not contagious, and it may occur at all ages and
many times. It comes and goes, remaining only a
short time in a place. It puts on very much the appearance
of the child having been stung by nettles—hence
its name. It produces great heat, itching, and
irritation, sometimes to such a degree as to make him
feverish, sick, and fretful. He is generally worse when
he is warm in bed, or when the surface of his body is
suddenly exposed to the air. Rubbing the skin, too,
always aggravates the itching and the tingling, and
brings out a fresh crop.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>cause</i> of nettle-rash may commonly be traced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1109'>1109</span>improper feeding; although, occasionally, it proceeds
from teething.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—It is a complaint of no danger, and
readily gives way to a mild aperient, and to attention
to diet. There is nothing better to relieve the irritation
of the skin than a warm bath. If it be a severe
attack of nettle-rash, by all means call in a medical
man.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not apply cold applications to
his skin, and do not wash him (while the rash is out)
in quite <i>cold</i> water. Do not allow him to be in a
draught, but let him be in a well-ventilated room. If
he be old enough to eat meat, keep it from him for a
few days, and let him live on milk and farinaceous
diet. Avoid strong purgatives, and calomel, and gray
powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>106. <i>What are the symptoms and the treatment of
Red-gum?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Red-gum, tooth-rash, red-gown, is usually owing to
irritation from teething; not always from the cutting,
but from the evolution, the “breeding,” of the teeth.
It is also sometimes owing to unhealthy stools irritating
the bowels, and showing itself, by sympathy, on
the skin. Red-gum consists of several small papulæ,
or pimples, about the size of pins’ heads, and may be
known from measles—the only disease for which it is
at all likely to be mistaken—by its being unattended
by symptoms of cold, such as sneezing, running, and
redness of the eyes, etc., and by the patches <i>not</i> assuming
a crescentic, half-moon shape; red-gum, in short,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1110'>1110</span>may readily be known by the child’s health being unaffected,
unless, indeed, there be a great crop of pimples;
then there will be slight feverishness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—Little need be done. If there be a good
deal of irritation, a mild aperient should be given. The
child ought to be kept moderately but not very warm.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Draughts of air, or cold, should be
carefully avoided; as, by sending the eruption suddenly
in, either convulsions or disordered bowels might be
produced. Do not dose him with gray powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>107. <i>How would you prevent “Stuffing of the nose”
in a new-born babe?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Rubbing a little tallow on the bridge of the nose is
the old-fashioned remedy, and answers the purpose.
It ought to be applied every evening just before putting
him to bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the “stuffing” be severe, dip a sponge in hot water,
as hot as he can comfortably bear; ascertain that it be
not too hot, by previously applying it to your own face,
and then put it for a few minutes to the bridge of his
nose. As soon as the hard mucus is within reach, it
should be carefully removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>108. <i>Do you consider sickness injurious to an
infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Many thriving babies are, after taking the breast,
frequently sick; still we cannot look upon sickness
otherwise than as an index of either a disordered or
of an overloaded stomach. If the child be sick, and
yet be thriving, it is a proof that he overloads his
stomach. A mother, then, must not allow him to suck
so much at a time. She should, until he retains all he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1111'>1111</span>takes, lessen the quantity of milk. If he be sick and
does <i>not</i> thrive, the mother should notice if the milk
he throws up has a sour smell; if it has, she must
first of all look to her own health; she ought to ascertain
if her own stomach be out of order; for if such
be the case, it is impossible for her to make good milk.
She should observe whether, in the morning, her own
tongue be furred and dry; whether she have a disagreeable
taste in her mouth, or pains at her stomach,
or heartburn, or flatulence. If she have all, or any
of these symptoms, the mystery is explained why he
is sick and does not thrive. She ought then to seek
advice, and a medical man will soon put her stomach
into good order; and, by so doing, will, at the same
time, benefit the child.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the mother be in the enjoyment of good health,
she must then look to the babe herself, and ascertain if
he be cutting his teeth; if the gums require lancing;
if the secretions from the bowels be proper both in
quantity and in quality; and, if he have had <i>artificial</i>
food—it being absolutely necessary to give such food—whether
it agree with him.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—In the first place, if the gums are red,
hot, and swollen, let them be lanced; in the second, if
the secretions from the bowels are either unhealthy or
scanty, give him a dose of aperient medicine, such as
castor oil, or the following: Take two or three grains
of powdered Turkey rhubarb, three grains of pure carbonate
of magnesia, and one grain of aromatic powder.
Mix. The powder to be taken at bedtime, mixed in a
teaspoonful of sugar and water, and which should, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1112'>1112</span>necessary, be repeated the following night. In the
third place, if the food he be taking does not agree
with him, change it (<i>vide</i> answer to question 33). Give
it in smaller quantities at a time, and not so frequently;
or, what will be better still, if it be possible, keep him,
for awhile, entirely to the breast.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not let him overload his
stomach either with breast-milk or <i>with artificial
food</i>. Let the mother avoid, until his sickness be relieved,
greens, cabbage, and all other green vegetables.</p>

<p class='c008'>109. <i>What are the causes, the symptoms, the prevention,
and the cure of Thrush?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The thrush is a frequent disease of an infant, and is
often brought on either by stuffing him or by giving
him improper food. A child brought up <i>entirely</i>, for
the first three or four months, on the breast, seldom
suffers from this complaint. The thrush consists of
several irregular, roundish, white specks on the lips, the
tongue, the inside and the angles of the mouth, giving
the parts affected the appearance of curds and whey
having been smeared upon them. The mouth is hot
and painful, and he is afraid to suck: the moment the
nipple is put into his mouth he begins to cry. The
thrush sometimes, although but rarely, runs through
the whole of the alimentary canal. It should be borne
in mind that nearly every child who is sucking has
his or her tongue white or “frosted” as it is sometimes
called. The thrush may be mild or very severe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now with regard to <i>What to do</i>.—As the thrush is
generally owing to improper and to artificial feeding,
<i>if the child be at the breast</i>, keep him, for a time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1113'>1113</span>entirely to it. Do not let him be always sucking, as
that will not only fret his mouth, but will likewise
irritate and make sore the mother’s nipple.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>If he be not at the breast</i>, but has been weaned, then
keep him for a few days entirely to a milk diet—to the
milk of <span class='fss'>ONE</span> cow—either boiled, if it be hot weather,
to keep it sweet; or unboiled, in cool weather—fresh
as it comes from the cow.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best medicine is the old-fashioned one of borax,
a combination of powdered lump sugar and borax being
a good one for the purpose: the powdered lump sugar
increases the efficacy and the cleansing properties of the
borax; it tends, moreover, to make it more palatable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Biborate of Soda, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Lump sugar, two scruples:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To be well mixed together, and made into twelve powders. One
of the powders to be put dry on the tongue every four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best <i>local</i> remedy is honey of borax, which
ought to be smeared frequently, by means of the finger,
on the parts affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorough ventilation of the apartment must be observed;
and great cleanliness of the vessels containing
the milk should be insisted upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a bad case of thrush, change of air to the country
is most desirable; the effect is sometimes, in such cases,
truly magical.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the thrush be brought on either by too much or
by improper food, in the first case, of course, a mother
must lessen the quantity; and, in the second, she should
be more careful in her selection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not use either a calf’s teat or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1114'>1114</span>wash-leather for the feeding-bottle; fortunately, since
the invention of india-rubber teats, they are now nearly
exploded; they were, in olden times, fruitful causes of
thrush. Do not mind the trouble of ascertaining that
the cooking-vessels connected with the baby’s food are
perfectly clean and sweet. Do not leave the purity and
the goodness of the cow’s milk (it being absolutely
necessary to feed him on artificial food) to be judged
either by the milkman or by the nurse, but taste and
prove it yourself. Do not keep the milk in a warm
place, but either in the dairy or in the cellar; and, if it
be summer time, let the jug holding the milk be put
in a crock containing lumps of ice. Do not use milk
that has been milked longer than twelve hours, but, if
practicable, have it milked direct from the cow, and use
it <i>immediately</i>—let it be really and truly fresh and
genuine milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease is <i>severe</i>, it may require more active
treatment—such as a dose of calomel; <i>which medicine
must never be given, unless it be either under the
direction of a medical man, or unless it be in an extreme
case,—such as dysentery</i>;<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c014'><sup>[181]</sup></a> therefore, the mother had
better seek advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a <i>severe</i> case of thrush, where the complaint has
been brought on by <i>artificial</i> feeding—the babe not
having the advantage of the mother’s milk—it is really
surprising how rapidly a wet-nurse—if the case has not
been too long deferred—will effect a cure, where all
other means have been tried and have failed. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1115'>1115</span>effect has been truly magical! In a severe case of
thrush, pure air and thorough ventilation are essential
to recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'>110. <i>Is anything to be learned from the cry of an
infant?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is a language in the cry of an infant which a
thoughtful medical man can well interpret. The cry
of hunger, for instance, is very characteristic,—it is
unaccompanied with tears, and is a wailing cry; the
cry of teething, is a fretful cry; the cry of earache is
short, sharp, piercing, and decisive, the head being
moved about from side to side, and the little hand being
often put up to the affected side of the head; the
cry of bowelache is also expressive,—the cry is not so
piercing as from earache, and is an interrupted, straining
cry, accompanied with a drawing up of the legs to
the belly; the cry of bronchitis is a gruff and phlegmatic
cry; the cry of inflammation of the lungs is more
a moan than a cry; the cry of croup is hoarse, and
rough, and ringing, and is so characteristic that it may
truly be called “the croupy cry,” moreover, he breathes
as though he breathed through muslin; the cry of inflammation
of the membranes of the brain is a piercing
shriek—a danger signal—most painful to hear; the cry
of a child recovering from a severe illness is a cross,
and wayward, and tearful cry; he may truly be said to
be in a quarrelsome mood; he bursts out without rhyme
or reason into a passionate flood of tears; tears are
always, in a severe illness, to be looked upon as a good
omen, as a sign of amendment: tears, when a child is
dangerously ill, are rarely if ever seen; a cry at night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1116'>1116</span>for light—a frequent cause of a babe crying—is a restless
cry:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“An infant crying in the night:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>An infant crying for the light:</div>
      <div class='line'>And with no language but a cry.”<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c014'><sup>[182]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>111. <i>If an infant be delicate, have you any objection
to his having either veal or mutton broth to strengthen
him?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Broths seldom agree with a babe at the breast. I
have known them produce sickness, disorder the bowels,
and create fever. I recommend you, therefore, not to
make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although broth and beef-tea, when taken by the
mouth, will seldom agree with an infant at the breast,
yet, when used as an enema, and in small quantities,
so that they may be retained, I have frequently found
them to be of great benefit: they have, in some instances,
appeared to have snatched delicate children
from the brink of the grave.</p>

<p class='c008'>112. <i>My babe’s ankles are very weak: what do you
advise to strengthen them?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If his ankles be weak, let them every morning be
bathed, after the completion of his morning’s ablution,
for five minutes each time, with bay salt and water, a
small handful of bay salt dissolved in a quart of rain
water (with the chill of the water taken off in the winter,
and of its proper temperature in the summer time);
then let them be dried; after the drying, let the ankles
be well rubbed with the following liniment:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1117'>1117</span>Take of—Oil of Rosemary, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Liniment of Camphor, thirteen drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Liniment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Do not let him be put on his feet early; but allow him
to crawl, and sprawl, and kick about the floor, until his
ankles become strong.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not, on any account, without having competent
advice on the subject, use iron instruments or mechanical
supports of any kind: the ankles are generally, by
such artificial supports, made worse, in consequence of
the pressure causing a further dwindling away and enfeebling
of the ligaments of the ankles, already wasted
and weakened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let him wear shoes, with straps over the insteps to
keep them on, and not boots: boots will only, by wasting
the ligaments, increase the weakness of the ankles.</p>

<p class='c008'>113. <i>Sometimes there is a difficulty in restraining
the bleeding of leech-bites. What is the best method?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The difficulty in these cases generally arises from the
improper method of performing it. For example—a
mother endeavors to stop the hemorrhage by loading
the part with rag; the more the bites discharge, the
more rag she applies. At the same time, the child
probably is in a room with a large fire, with two or
three candles, with the doors closed, and with perhaps
a dozen people in the apartment, whom the mother has,
in her fright, sent for. This practice is strongly reprehensible.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the bleeding cannot be stopped,—in the first place,
the fire must be extinguished, the door and windows
should be thrown open, and the room ought to be cleared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1118'>1118</span>of persons, with the exception of one, or, at the most,
two; and every rag should be removed. “Stopping
of leech-bites.—The simplest and most certain way,
till the proper assistance is obtained, is the pressure of
the finger, with nothing intervening. It <i>cannot</i> bleed
through that.”<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c014'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Many babies have lost their lives by excessive loss
of blood from leech-bites, from a mother not knowing
how to act, and also from the medical man either living
at a distance, or not being at hand. Fortunately for
the infantile community, leeches are now very seldom
ordered by doctors.</p>

<p class='c008'>114. <i>Supposing a baby to be poorly, have you any advice
to give to his mother as to her own management?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>She must endeavor to calm her feelings, or her milk
will be disordered, and she will thus materially increase
his illness. If he be laboring under any inflammatory
disorder, she ought to refrain from the taking of beer,
wine, and spirits, and from all stimulating food; otherwise,
she will feed his disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before concluding the first part of my subject—the
Management of Infancy—let me again urge upon you
the importance—the paramount importance—if you wish
your babe to be strong and hearty,—of giving him as
little opening physic as possible. The best physic for
him is Nature’s physic—fresh air and exercise and simplicity
of living. A mother who is herself always
drugging her child, can only do good to two persons—the
doctor and the druggist!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1119'>1119</span>If an infant from his birth be properly managed,—if
he has an abundance of fresh air for his lungs,—if he
has plenty of exercise for his muscles (by allowing him
to kick and sprawl on the floor),—if he has a good
swilling and sousing of water for his skin,—if, during
the <i>early</i> months of his life, he has nothing but the
mother’s milk for his stomach,—he will require very
little medicine—the less the better! He does not want
his stomach to be made into a doctor’s shop! The
grand thing is not to take every opportunity of administering
physic, but of using every means of withholding
it! And if physic be necessary, not to doctor
him yourself, unless it be in extreme and urgent cases
(which in preceding and succeeding Conversations I
either have or will indicate), but to employ an experienced
medical man. A babe who is always, without
rhyme or reason, being physicked, is sure to be
puny, delicate, and unhealthy, and is ready, at any
moment, to drop into an untimely grave!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CONCLUDING REMARKS ON INFANCY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>115. In concluding the first part of our subject—Infancy—I
beg to remark. There are four things essentially
necessary to an infant’s well-doing, namely,
(1) plenty of water for the skin; (2) plenty of milk
for the stomach; (3) plenty of fresh air for the lungs;
(4) plenty of sleep for the brain: these are the four
grand essentials for a babe; without an abundance
of each and all of them, perfect health is utterly impossible!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>ABLUTION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>116. <i>At twelve months old, do you still recommend
a child to be</i> <span class='fss'>PUT IN HIS TUB</span> <i>to be washed?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly I do, as I have previously recommended
at page <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>, in order that his skin may be well and
thoroughly cleansed. If it be summer time, the water
should be used cold; if it be winter, a dash of warm
must be added, so that it may be of the temperature of
new milk; but do not, on any account, use <i>very warm</i>
water. The head must be washed (but not dried) before
he be placed in his tub; then, putting him in the tub
(containing the necessary quantity of water, and washing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1121'>1121</span>him as previously recommended),<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c014'><sup>[184]</sup></a> a large sponge
should be filled with the water and squeezed over the
head, so that the water may stream over the whole
surface of the body. A jugful of cold water should,
just before taking him out of his bath, be poured over
and down his loins; all this ought rapidly to be done,
and he must be quickly dried with soft towels, and then
expeditiously dressed. For the washing of your child
I would recommend you to use Castile soap in preference
to any other: it is more pure, and less irritating,
and hence does not injure the texture of the skin.
Take care that the soap does not get into his eyes,
or it might produce irritation and smarting.</p>

<p class='c008'>117. <i>Some mothers object to a child’s</i> <span class='fss'>STANDING</span> <i>in
the water</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the head be wetted before he be placed in the tub,
and if he be washed as above directed, there can be no
valid objection to it. He must not be allowed to remain
in the tub more than five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>118. <i>Does not washing the child’s head, every morning,
make him more liable to catch cold, and does it not
tend to weaken his sight?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It does neither the one nor the other; on the contrary,
it prevents cold, and strengthens the sight; it
cleanses the scalp, prevents scurf, and, by that means,
causes a more beautiful head of hair. The head, after
each washing, ought to be well brushed with a soft
brush, but should not be combed. The brushing causes
a healthy circulation of the scalp.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1122'>1122</span>119. <i>If the head, notwithstanding the washing, be
scurfy, what should be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>After the head has been well dried, let a little cocoanut
oil be well rubbed, for five minutes each time, into
the roots of the hair, and, afterward, let the head be
well brushed, but not combed. The fine-tooth comb
will cause a greater accumulation of scurf, and will
scratch and injure the scalp.</p>

<p class='c008'>120. <i>Do you recommend a child to be washed</i> <span class='fss'>IN HIS
TUB</span> <i>every night and morning</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>No; once a day is quite sufficient; in the morning
in preference to the evening; unless he be poorly, then,
evening instead of morning; as, immediately after he
has been washed and dried, he can be put to bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>121. <i>Ought a child to be placed in his tub while he
is in a state of perspiration?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Not while he is perspiring <i>violently</i>, or the perspiration
might be checked suddenly, and ill consequences
would ensue; <i>nor ought he to be put in his tub when
he is cold</i>, or his blood would be chilled, and would be
sent from the skin to some internal vital part, and thus
would be likely to light up inflammation—probably of
the lungs. His skin, when he is placed in his bath,
ought to be moderately and comfortably warm; neither
too hot nor too cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>122. <i>When the child is a year old, do you recommend
cold or warm water to be used?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If it be winter, a little warm water ought to be added,
so as to raise the temperature to that of new milk. As
the summer advances, less and less warm water is
required, so that, at length, none is needed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1123'>1123</span>123. <i>If a child be delicate, do you recommend anything
to be added to the water which may tend to brace
and strengthen him?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Either a handful of table salt or half a handful of
bay salt should be previously dissolved in a quart jug—of
<i>cold</i> water; then, just before taking the child out of
his morning bath, let the above be poured over and
down the back and loins of the child—holding the jug,
while pouring its contents on the back, twelve inches
from the child, in order that it might act as a kind of
douche bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>124. <i>Do you recommend the child, after he has been
dried with the towel, to be rubbed with the hand?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do; as friction encourages the cutaneous circulation,
and causes the skin to perform its functions properly,
thus preventing the perspiration (which is one of
the impurities of the body) from being sent inwardly
either to the lungs or to other parts. The back, the
chest, the bowels, and the limbs are the parts that
ought to be well rubbed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CLOTHING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>125. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the clothing
of a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Children—boys and girls—especially if they be
delicate, ought always to wear high dresses up to
their necks. The exposure of the upper part of the
chest (if the child be weakly) is dangerous. It is
in the <i>upper</i> part of the lungs, in the region of the
collar bones, that consumption first shows itself. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1124'>1124</span>clothing of a child, more especially about the chest,
should be large and full in every part, and be free
from tight strings, so that the circulation of the blood
may not be impeded, and that there may be plenty of
room for the full development of the rapidly growing
body.</p>

<p class='c008'>His frock or tunic ought to be of woolen material—warm,
light, and porous, in order that the perspiration
may rapidly evaporate. The practice of some
mothers in allowing their children to wear tight
bands round their waists, and tight clothes, is truly
reprehensible.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Tight</i> bands or <i>tight</i> belts around the waist of a
child are very injurious to health; they crib in the
chest, and thus interfere with the rising and the falling
of the ribs—so essential to breathing. <i>Tight</i> hats
ought never to be worn; by interfering with the circulation
they cause headaches. Nature delights in
freedom, and resents interference!</p>

<p class='c008'>126. <i>What parts of the body in particular ought to
be kept warm?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The chest, the bowels, and the feet should be kept
comfortably warm. We must guard against an opposite
extreme, and not keep them too hot. The head
alone should be kept cool, on which account I do not
approve either of night or of day caps.</p>

<p class='c008'>127. <i>What are the best kinds of hat for a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The best covering for the head, when he is out and
about, is a loose-fitting straw hat, which will allow the
perspiration to escape. It should have a broad brim,
to screen the eyes. A sunshade, that is to say, a sea-side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1125'>1125</span>hat—a hat made of cotton, with a wide brim to
keep off the sun—is also an excellent hat for a child; it
is very light, and allows a free escape of the perspiration.
It can be bought, ready made, at a baby-linen
warehouse.</p>

<p class='c008'>A knitted or crocheted woolen hat, with woolen
rosettes to keep the ears warm, and which may be
procured at any baby-linen warehouse, makes a nice
and comfortable winter’s hat for a child. It is also a
good hat for him to wear while performing a long
journey. The color chosen is generally scarlet and
white, which, in cold weather, gives it a warm and
comfortable appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is an abominable practice to cover a child’s head
either with beaver or with felt, or with any thick, impervious
material. It is a well-ascertained fact, that
both beaver and silk hats cause men to suffer from
headache, and to lose their hair—the reason being
that the perspiration cannot possibly escape through
them. Now, if the perspiration cannot escape, dangerous,
or at all events injurious, consequences must
ensue, as it is well known that the skin is a breathing
apparatus, and that it will not with impunity bear interference.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither a child nor any one else should be permitted
to be in the glare of the sun without his hat. If he be
allowed, he is likely to have a sun-stroke, which might
either at once kill him, or might make him an idiot for
the remainder of his life, which latter would be the
worse alternative of the two.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1126'>1126</span>128. <i>Have you any remarks to make on keeping a
child’s hands and legs warm when, in the winter time,
he is carried out?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>When a child either walks or is carried out in wintry
weather, be sure and see that both his hands and legs
are well protected from the cold. There is nothing for
this purpose like woolen gloves, and woolen stockings
coming up over the knees.</p>

<p class='c008'>129. <i>Do you approve of a child wearing a flannel
night-gown?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He frequently throws the clothes off him, and has
occasion to be taken up in the night, and if he has not
a flannel gown on is likely to catch cold; on which account
I recommend it to be worn. The usual calico
night-gown should be worn <i>under</i> it.</p>

<p class='c008'>130. <i>Do you advise a child to be</i> <span class='fss'>LIGHTLY</span> <i>clad, in
order that he may be hardened thereby?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I should fear that such a plan, instead of hardening,
would be likely to produce a contrary effect. It is an
ascertained fact that more children of the poor, who
are thus lightly clad, die, than of those who are properly
defended from the cold. Again, what holds good
with a young plant is equally applicable to a young
child; and we all know that it is ridiculous to think of
unnecessarily exposing a tender plant to harden it. If
it were thus exposed, it would wither and die!</p>

<p class='c008'>131. <i>If a child be delicate, if he has a cold body or
a languid circulation, or if he be predisposed to inflammation
of the lungs, do you approve of his wearing
flannel instead of linen shirts?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do; as flannel tends to keep the body at an equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1127'>1127</span>temperature, thus obviating the effects of the sudden
changes of the weather, and promotes, by gentle friction,
the cutaneous circulation, thus warming the cold
body, and giving an impetus to the languid circulation,
and preventing an undue quantity of blood from being
sent to the lungs, either to light up or to feed inflammation.
<i>Fine</i> flannel, of course, ought to be worn,
which should be changed as frequently as the usual
shirts.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a child has had an attack either of bronchitis or of
inflammation of the lungs, or if he has just recovered
from scarlet fever, by all means, if he has not previously
worn flannel, <i>instantly</i> let him begin to do so, and let
him, next to the skin, wear a flannel waistcoat. <i>This
is important advice, and ought not to be disregarded.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>Scarlet</i> flannel is now much used instead of <i>white</i>
flannel; and as scarlet flannel has a more comfortable
appearance, and does not shrink so much in washing,
it may for the white be substituted.</p>

<p class='c008'>132. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the shoes and
stockings of a child? and on the right way of cutting
the toe-nails?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He ought, during the winter, to wear lambs’ wool
stockings that will reach <i>above</i> the knees, and <i>thick</i>
calico drawers that will reach a few inches <i>below</i> the
knees; as it is of the utmost importance to keep the
lower extremities comfortably warm. It is really painful
to see how many mothers expose the bare legs of
their little ones to the frosty air, even in the depths of
winter. “Tender little children are exposed to the
bitterest weather, with their legs bared in a manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1128'>1128</span>that would inevitably injure the health of strong
adults.”<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c014'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Garters ought not to be worn, as they impede the
circulation, waste the muscles, and interfere with walking.
The stocking may be secured in its place by
means of a loop and tape, which should be fastened to
a part of the dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me urge upon you the importance of not allowing
your child to wear <i>tight</i> shoes; they cripple the feet,
causing the joints of the toes, which ought to have free
play, and which should assist in walking, to be, in a
manner, useless; they produce corns and bunions, and
interfere with the proper circulation of the foot. A
shoe ought to be made according to the shape of the
foot—rights and lefts are therefore desirable. The toe-part
of the shoe must be made broad, so as to allow
plenty of room for the toes to expand, and that one toe
cannot overlap another. Be sure, then, that there be
no pinching and no pressure. In the article of shoes
you ought to be particular and liberal; pay attention
to having nicely fitting ones, and let them be made of
soft leather, and throw them on one side the moment
they are too small. It is poor economy, indeed, because
a pair of shoes be not worn out, to run the risk of incurring
the above evil consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Shoes are far preferable to boots</i>; boots weaken
instead of strengthen the ankle. The ankle and instep
require free play, and ought not to be hampered by
boots. Moreover, boots, by undue pressure, decidedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1129'>1129</span>waste away the ligaments of the ankle. Boots act on
the ankles in a similar way that stays do on the waist—they
do mischief by pressure. Boots waste away the
ligaments of the ankle; stays waste away the muscles
of the back and chest: and thus, in both cases, do irreparable
mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>A shoe for a child ought to be made with a narrow
strap over the instep, and with button and button-hole:
if it be not made in this way, the shoe will not keep on
the foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a grievous state of things that in this nineteenth
century there are very few shoemakers in England who
know how to make a shoe! The shoe is made not to
fit the real foot, but a fashionable imaginary one!</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me strongly urge you to be particular that the
sock or stocking fits nicely—that it is neither too small
nor too large; if it be too small, it binds up the toes
unmercifully, and makes one toe to ride over the other,
and thus renders the toes perfectly useless in walking;
if it be too large, it is necessary to lap a portion of the
sock or stocking either under or over the toes, which
thus presses unduly upon them, and gives pain and
annoyance. It should be borne in mind that if the toes
have full play, they, as it were, grasp the ground, and
greatly assist in locomotion—which, of course, if they
are cramped up, they cannot possibly do. Be careful
too, that the toe-part of the sock or stocking be not
pointed; let it be made square, in order to give room
to the toes. “At this helpless period of life the delicately
feeble, outspreading toes, are wedged into a narrow-toed
stocking, often so short as to double in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1130'>1130</span>toes, diminishing the length of the rapidly-growing
foot! It is next, perhaps, tightly laced into a boot of
less interior dimensions than itself; when the poor little
creature is left to sprawl about with a limping, stumping
gait, thus learning to walk as it best can, under
circumstances the most cruel and torturing imaginable.”<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c014'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible for either a stocking or a shoe to
fit nicely, unless the toe-nails be kept in proper order.
Now, in cutting the toe-nails there is, as in everything
else, a right and a wrong way. The <i>right</i> way of cutting
a toe-nail is to cut it straight—in a straight line.
The <i>wrong</i> way is to cut the corners of the nail—to
round the nail, as it is called. This cutting the corners
of the nails often makes work for the surgeon, as I
myself can testify; it frequently produces “growing-in”
of the nail, which sometimes necessitates the removal
of either the nail or of a portion of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>133. <i>At what time of the year should a child leave
off his winter clothing?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A mother ought not to leave off her children’s winter
clothing until the spring be far advanced: it is far
better to be on the safe side, and to allow the winter
clothes to be worn until the end of May. The old adage
is very good, and should be borne in mind:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“Button to chin</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1131'>1131</span>134. <i>Have you any general remarks to make on the
present fashion of dressing children?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The present fashion is absurd. Children are frequently
dressed like mountebanks, with feathers and
furbelows and finery: the boys go bare-legged; the
little girls are dressed like women, with their stuck-out
petticoats, crinolines, and low dresses! Their poor little
waists are drawn in tight, so that they can scarcely
breathe; their dresses are very low and short, the consequence
is, that a great part of the chest is exposed to
our variable climate; their legs are bare down to their
thin socks, or, if they be clothed, they are only covered
with gossamer drawers; while their feet are incased
in tight shoes of paper thickness! Dress! dress! dress!
is made with them at a tender age, and, when first
impressions are the strongest, a most important consideration.
They are thus rendered vain and frivolous,
and are taught to consider dress “as the one thing
needful.” And if they live to be women—which the
present fashion is likely frequently to prevent—what
are they? Silly, simpering, delicate, lackadaisical
nonentities,—dress being their amusement, their occupation,
their conversation, their everything, their thoughts
by day and their dreams by night! Let children be
dressed as children, not as men and women. Let them
be taught that dress is quite a secondary consideration.
Let health, and not fashion, be the first, and we shall
have, with God’s blessing, blooming children, who will,
in time, be the pride and strength of dear old England!
Oh that the time may come, and may not be far distant,
“That our sons may grow up as the young plants, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1132'>1132</span>that our daughters may be as the polished corners of
the temple.”<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c014'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'>DIET.</h4>

<p class='c018'>135. <i>At</i> <span class='fss'>TWELVE</span> <i>months old, have you any objection
to a child having any other food besides that you mentioned
in answer to the 34th question</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no objection to his <i>occasionally</i> having for
dinner either a mealy, <i>mashed</i> potato and gravy, or a
few crumbs of bread and gravy. Rice pudding or batter pudding
may, for a change, be given; but remember,
the food recommended in a former Conversation is what,
until he be eighteen months old, must be principally
taken. During the early months of infancy—say, for
the first six or seven—if artificial food be given at all,
it should be administered by means of a feeding-bottle.
After that time, either a spoon or a nursing-boat will
be preferable. As he becomes older, the food ought to
be made more solid.</p>

<p class='c008'>136. <i>At</i> <span class='fss'>EIGHTEEN</span> <i>months old, have you any objection
to a child having meat</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>He ought not to have meat until he has several teeth
to chew it with. If he has most of his teeth—which
he very likely, at this age, will have—there is no objection
to his taking a small slice either of mutton or occasionally
of roast beef, which should be well cut into
very small pieces, and mixed with a mealy, <i>mashed</i>
potato, and a few crumbs of bread and gravy, either
<i>every</i> day, if he be delicate, or every <i>other</i> day, if he be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1133'>1133</span>a gross or a fast-feeding child. It may be well, in the
generality of cases, for the first few months to give him
meat <i>every other</i> day, and either potato and gravy, or
rice or suet-pudding or batter pudding on the alternate
days; indeed, I think so highly of rice, of suet, and of
batter puddings, and of other farinaceous puddings,
that I should advise you to let him have either the one
or the other, even on those days that he has meat—giving
it him <i>after</i> his meat. But remember, if he have
meat <i>and</i> pudding, the meat ought to be given sparingly.
If he be gorged with food, it makes him irritable,
cross, and stupid; at one time, clogging up the
bowels and producing constipation; at another, disordering
the liver, and causing either clay-colored stools,
denoting a <i>deficiency</i> of bile, or dark and offensive
motions, telling of <i>vitiated</i> bile; while, in a third case,
cramming him with food might bring on convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>137. <i>As you are so partial to puddings for a child,
which do you consider the best for him?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He ought, every day, to have a pudding for his dinner—either
rice, arrow-root, sago, tapioca, suet-pudding,
batter pudding, or Yorkshire-pudding, mixed with
crumbs of bread and gravy—free from grease. A well-boiled
suet-pudding, with plenty of suet in it, is one of
the best puddings he can have; it is, in point of fact,
meat and farinaceous food combined, and is equal to
and will oftentimes prevent the giving of cod-liver oil.
Before cod-liver oil came into vogue, suet boiled in milk
was <i>the</i> remedy for a delicate child; he may, occasionally,
have fruit-pudding, provided the pastry be both
plain and light.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1134'>1134</span>The objection to fruit pies and puddings is, that the
pastry is often too rich for the delicate stomach of a
child: there is no objection, certainly not, to the fruit—cooked
fruit being, for a child, most wholesome; if,
therefore, fruit puddings and pies be eaten, the pastry
part ought to be quite plain. There is, in “Murray’s
Modern Cookery Book,” an excellent suggestion, which
I will take the liberty of quoting, and of strongly urging
my fair reader to carry into practice: “<i>To prepare
fruit for children, a far more wholesome way than
in pies and puddings</i>, is to put apples sliced, or plums,
currants, gooseberries, etc. into a stone jar, and sprinkle
among them as much Lisbon sugar as necessary.
Set the jar on an oven or on a hearth, with a teacupful
of water to prevent the fruit from burning; or put the
jar into a saucepan of water, till its contents be perfectly
done. Slices of bread or some rice may be put
into the jar, to eat with the fruit.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Jam</i>—such as strawberry, raspberry, gooseberry—<i>is
most wholesome for a child</i>, and ought occasionally
to be given, in lieu of sugar, with the rice, with the
batter, and with the other puddings. Marmalade, too,
is very wholesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>Puddings ought to be given <i>after</i> and not <i>before</i> his
meat and vegetables; if you give him pudding before
his meat, he might refuse to eat meat altogether.</p>

<p class='c008'>By adopting the plan of giving puddings <i>every</i> day,
your child will require <i>less</i> animal food: <i>much</i> meat is
injurious to a young child.</p>

<p class='c008'>But do not run into an opposite extreme: a <i>little</i>
meat ought, every day, to be given, <i>provided he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1135'>1135</span>cut the whole of his first set of teeth</i>; until then, meat
every <i>other</i> day will be often enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>138. <i>As soon as a child has cut the whole of his
first set of teeth, what ought to be his diet? What
should be his breakfast?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He can, then, have nothing better, where it agrees,
than scalding-hot new milk poured on sliced bread,
with a slice or two of bread and butter to eat with it.
Butter, in moderation, is nourishing, fattening, and
wholesome. Moreover, butter tends to keep the bowels
regular. These facts should be borne in mind, as some
mothers foolishly keep their children from butter, declaring
it to be too rich for their children’s stomachs!
New milk should be used in preference either to cream
or to skimmed milk. Cream, as a rule, is too rich for
the delicate stomach of a child, and skim-milk is too poor
when robbed of the butter which the cream contains.
But give cream and, water, where new milk (as is
<i>occasionally</i> the case) does not agree; but never give
skim-milk. <i>Skim</i>-milk (among other evils) produces
costiveness, and necessitates the frequent administration
of aperients. Cream, on the other hand, regulates
and tends to open the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although, as a rule, I am not so partial to cream as
I am to good genuine fresh milk, yet I have found, in
cases of great debility, more especially where a child
is much exhausted by some inflammatory disease, such
as inflammation of the lungs, the following food most
serviceable: Beat up, by means of a fork, the yolk of
an egg, then mix, little by little, half a teacupful of very
weak <i>black</i> tea, sweeten with one lump of sugar, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1136'>1136</span>add a tablespoonful of cream. Let the foregoing, by
teaspoonfuls at a time, be frequently given.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above food is only to be administered until the
exhaustion be removed, and is not to supersede the
milk diet, which must, at stated periods, be given, as
I have recommended in answers to previous and subsequent
questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a child has costive bowels, there is nothing
better for his breakfast than well-made and well-boiled
oatmeal stir-about, which ought to be eaten with milk
fresh from the cow. Scotch children scarcely take anything
else, and a finer race is not in existence; and, as
for physic, many of them do not even know either the
taste or the smell of it!</p>

<p class='c008'>139. <i>Have you any remarks to make on cow’s milk,
as an article of food?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Cow’s milk is a valuable, indeed, an indispensable
article of diet for children; it is most nourishing, wholesome,
and digestible. The finest and the healthiest
children are those who, for the first four or five years
of their lives, are fed <i>principally</i> upon it. Milk ought
then to be their staple food.</p>

<p class='c008'>No young child, as a rule, can live, or, if he live, can
be healthy, unless milk is the staple article of his diet.
There is no substitute for milk. To prove the fattening
and strengthening qualities of milk, look only at a
young calf who lives on milk, and on milk alone! He
is a Samson in strength, and is as fat as butter; and
all young things are fat if they are in health!</p>

<p class='c008'>Milk contains every ingredient to build up the body,
which is more than can be said of any other known substance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1137'>1137</span>A child may live entirely, and become both
healthy and strong, on milk, and on milk alone, as it
contains every constituent of the human body. A child
cannot “live by bread alone,” but he might on milk
alone! Milk is animal and vegetable—it is meat and
bread—it is a fluid, but as soon as it reaches the stomach
it becomes a solid<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c014'><sup>[188]</sup></a>—solid food; it is the most important
and valuable article of diet for a child in existence.
It is a glorious food for the young, and must never, in
any case, be dispensed with. “Considering that milk
contains in itself most of the constituents of a perfect
diet, and is capable of maintaining life in infancy without
the aid of any other substance, it is marvelous
that the consumption of it is practically limited to so
small a class; and not only so, but that in sick-rooms,
where the patient is surrounded with every luxury,
arrow-root, and other compounds containing much less
nutriment, should so often be preferred to it.”<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c014'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Do not let me be misunderstood. I do not mean to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1138'>1138</span>say but that the mixing of farinaceous food—such as
Lemann’s Biscuit Powder, Robb’s Biscuit, Hard’s Farinaceous
Food, Brown and Polson’s Corn Flour, and
the like, with the milk, is an improvement—a great improvement;
but still I maintain that a child might live
and thrive, and that for a lengthened period, on milk—and
on milk alone!</p>

<p class='c008'>A dog will live and fatten for six weeks on milk alone!
while he will starve and die in a shorter period on strong
beef-tea alone!</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a grievous sin for a milkman to adulterate milk.
How many a poor infant has fallen a victim to that
crime!—for crime it may truly be called.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is folly in the extreme for a mother to bate a milkman
down in the price of his milk; if she does, the
milk is sure to be either of inferior quality, or adulterated,
or diluted with water; and woe betide the poor
unfortunate child if it be either the one or the other!
The only way to insure good milk is to go to a respectable
cow-keeper, and let him be made to thoroughly
understand the importance of your child having <i>genuine</i>
milk, and that you are then willing to pay a fair remunerative
price for it. Rest assured, that if you have
to pay one penny or even twopence a quart more for
<i>genuine</i> milk, it is one of the best investments that you
ever have made, or that you are ever likely to make,
in this world! Cheap and inferior milk might well be
called cheap and nasty; for inferior or adulterated milk
is the very essence, the conglomeration, of nastiness;
and, moreover, is very poisonous to a child’s stomach.
One and the principal reason why so many children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1139'>1139</span>are rickety and scrofulous, is the horrid stuff called
milk that is usually given to them. It is a crying evil,
and demands a thorough investigation and reformation,
and the individual interference of every parent.
Limited Liability Companies are the order of the day;
it would really be not a bad speculation if one was
formed in every large town, in order to insure good,
genuine, and undiluted milk.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Young</i> children, as a rule, are allowed to eat too
much meat. It is a mistaken notion of a mother that
they require so much animal food. If more milk were
given, and less meat, they would be healthier, and
would not be so predisposed to disease, especially to
skin disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should strongly recommend you, then, to be extravagant
in your milk score. Each child ought, in the
twenty-four hours, to take at least a quart of good, fresh,
new milk. It should, of course, be given in various
ways,—as bread and milk, rice puddings, milk, and
different kinds of farinaceous food, stir-about, etc. etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>140. <i>But suppose my child will not take milk, he
having an aversion to it, what ought then to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Boil the milk, and sweeten it to suit his palate.
After he has been accustomed to it for awhile, he will
then, probably, like milk. Gradually reduce the sugar
until at length it be dispensed with. A child will
often take milk this way, whereas he will not otherwise
touch it.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a child will not drink milk, he <i>must</i> eat meat; it
is absolutely necessary that he should have either the
one or the other; and, if he has cut nearly all his teeth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1140'>1140</span>he ought to have both meat and milk—the former in
moderation, the latter in abundance.</p>

<p class='c008'>141. <i>Supposing milk should not agree with my child,
what must then be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Milk, either boiled or unboiled, almost always agrees
with a child. If it does not, it must be looked upon as
the exception, and not the rule. I would, in such a case,
advise one-eighth of lime-water to be added to seven-eighths
of new milk—that is to say, two tablespoonfuls
of lime-water should be mixed with half a pint of new
milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>142. <i>Can you tell me of a way to prevent milk, in
hot weather, from turning sour?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let the jug of milk be put into a crock containing ice—either
in the dairy or in the cellar. The ice should be
kept, wrapped either in flannel or in a blanket, in a cool
place until it be wanted.</p>

<p class='c008'>143. <i>Is it necessary to give a child luncheon?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If he want anything to eat between breakfast and
dinner, let him have a piece of <i>dry</i> bread; and if he has
eaten very heartily at dinner, and, like Oliver Twist,
“asks for more!” give him, to satisfy his craving, a
piece of <i>dry</i> bread. He will never eat more of that
than will do him good, and yet he will take sufficient
to satisfy his hunger, which is very important.</p>

<p class='c008'>144. <i>What ought now to be his dinner?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He should now have meat, either mutton or beef,
daily, which must be cut up very small, and should be
mixed with mealy <i>mashed</i> potato and gravy. He ought
<i>always</i> to be accustomed to eat salt with his dinner.
Let a mother see that this advice is followed, or evil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1141'>1141</span>consequences will inevitably ensue. Let him be closely
watched, to ascertain that he well masticates his food,
and that he does not eat too quickly; for young children
are apt to bolt their food.</p>

<p class='c008'>145. <i>Have you any objection to pork for a change?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I have a great objection to it for the young. It is
a rich, gross, and therefore unwholesome food for the
delicate stomach of a child. I have known it, in several
instances, produce violent pain, sickness, purging, and
convulsions. If a child be fed much upon such meat, it
will be likely to produce “breakings-out” on the skin.
In fine, his blood will put on the same character as the
food he is fed with. Moreover, pork might be considered
a <i>strong</i> meat, and “<i>strong</i> meat and <i>strong</i>
drink can only be taken by <i>strong</i> men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>146. <i>Do you approve of veal for a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>My objection to pork was, that it was rich and gross;
this does not apply to veal; but the objection to it is,
that it is more difficult of digestion than either mutton
or beef.</p>

<p class='c008'>147. <i>Do you disapprove of salted and boiled beef for
a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If beef be <i>much</i> salted it is hard of digestion, and
therefore ought not to be given to him; but if it has
been but <i>slightly</i> salted, then for a change there will be
no objection to a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no necessity in the <i>winter</i> time to <i>salt</i> meat
intended for boiling; then, boiled <i>unsalted</i> meat makes
a nice change for a child’s dinner. Salt, of course,
<i>must</i> with the unsalted meat be eaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>148. <i>But suppose there is nothing on the table that a
child may with impunity eat?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1142'>1142</span>He should then have either a grilled mutton-chop, or
a lightly boiled egg; indeed, the latter, at any time,
makes an excellent change.</p>

<p class='c008'>149. <i>Are potatoes an unwholesome food for a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>New ones are; but old potatoes, well cooked and
mealy, are the best vegetable he can have. They
ought to be <i>well mashed</i>, as I have known lumps of
potatoes cause convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>150. <i>Do you approve of any other vegetables for a
child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Occasionally. Either asparagus, or broccoli, or cauliflower,
or turnips, or French beans, which latter should
be cut up fine, may with advantage be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>151. <i>Might not a mother be too particular in dieting
her child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. If blood can be too pure and too good
she might! When we take into account that the food
we eat is converted into blood; that if the food be
good, the blood is good; and that if the food be
improper or impure, the blood is impure likewise; and,
moreover, when we know that every part of the body
is built up by the blood, we cannot be considered to be
too particular in making our selection of food. Besides,
if indigestible or improper food be taken into the
stomach, the blood will not only be made impure, but
the stomach and the bowels will be disordered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not let me be misunderstood: I am no advocate
for a child having the same food one day as another—certainly
not. Let there be variety, but let it be <i>wholesome</i>
variety. Variety in a child’s (not in an infant’s)
food is necessary. If he were fed, day after day, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1143'>1143</span>mutton, his stomach would at length be brought into
that state that in time it would not properly digest
any other meat, and a miserable existence would be
the result.</p>

<p class='c008'>152. <i>What ought a child to drink with his dinner?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Toast and water, or, if he prefer it, plain spring
water. Let him have as much as he likes. If you
give him water to drink, there is no fear of his taking
too much; Nature will tell him when he has had
enough. Be careful of the quality of the water, and
the source from which you procure it. Soft spring
water from a moderately deep well is the best. If it
come from a land spring, it is apt, indeed is almost sure
to be contaminated by drains, etc., which is a frequent
cause of fevers, of diphtheria, of Asiatic cholera, and of
other blood poisons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guard against the drinking water being contaminated
with lead; never, therefore, allow the water to be collected
in leaden cisterns, as it sometimes is if the water
be obtained from Water-works’ companies. Lead
pumps, for the same reason, ought never to be used for
drinking purposes. Paralysis, constipation, lead colic,
dropping of the wrist, wasting of the ball of the thumb,
loss of memory and broken and ruined health might
result from neglect of this advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>All honor to the man who first invented the Drinking
Fountain, and all honor to the mayors and corporations
of towns who see that they are kept in good,
efficient working order! The drinking fountains are a
great boon to poor children, as water, and plenty of it,
is one of the chief necessaries of their very existence:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1144'>1144</span>and, unfortunately, at their own homes they are not,
oftentimes, able to obtain a sufficient supply. Moreover,
drinking fountains are the best advocates for
temperance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some parents are in the habit of giving their children
beer with their dinners, making them live as they
live themselves! This practice is truly absurd, and
fraught with great danger—not only so, but it is inducing
a child to be fond of that which in after-life
might be his bane and curse. No good end can be obtained
by it; it will <i>not</i> strengthen so young a child;
it will, on the contrary, create fever, and will thereby
weaken him; it will act injuriously upon his delicate,
nervous, and vascular systems, and might be a means
of producing inflammation either of the brain or of its
membranes, and might thus cause water on the brain
(a disease to which young children are subject), or it
might induce inflammation of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>153. <i>What ought a child who has cut his teeth to
have for his supper?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The same that he has for breakfast. He should sup
at six o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>154. <i>Have you any general remarks to make on a
child’s meals?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I recommended a great sameness in an <i>infant’s</i> diet;
but a <i>child’s</i> meals, his dinners especially, ought to be
much varied. For instance, do not let him have, day
after day, mutton; but ring the changes on mutton,
beef, poultry, game, and even occasionally fish—sole
or cod.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only let there be a change of meat, but let there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1145'>1145</span>be a change in the manner of cooking it: let the meat
sometimes be roasted; at other times let it be boiled.
I have known a mother who has prided herself as being
experienced in these matters, feed her child, day after
day, on mutton-chops! Such a proceeding is most injurious
to him, as after awhile his unfortunate stomach
will digest nothing but mutton-chops, and, in time, not
even those!</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to vegetables, potatoes—<i>mashed</i> potatoes—ought
to be his staple vegetable; but, every now
and then, cauliflower, asparagus, turnips, and French
beans should be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to puddings, vary them,—rice, one day;
suet, another; batter, a third; tapioca, a fourth; or,
even occasionally, he might have either apple or gooseberry
or rhubarb-pudding, provided the pastry be plain
and light.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is an excellent plan, as I have before remarked, to
let a child eat jam—such as strawberry, raspberry, or
gooseberry—and that without stint, either with rice or
with batter puddings.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Variety of diet</i>, then, is <i>good for a child</i>: it will
give him muscle, bone, and sinew; and, what is very
important, it will tend to regulate his bowels, and it
will thus prevent the necessity of giving him aperients.</p>

<p class='c008'>But do not stuff a child—do not press him, as is the
wont of some mothers, to eat more than he feels inclined.
On the contrary, if you think that he is eating
too much—that he is overloading his stomach—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1146'>1146</span>if he should ask for more, then, instead of giving
him either more meat or more pudding, give him a
piece of dry bread. By doing so, you may rest assured
that he will not eat more than is absolutely good
for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>155. <i>If a child be delicate, is there any objection to
a little wine, such as cowslip or tent, to strengthen
him?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Wine ought not to be given to a child unless it be
ordered by a medical man: it is even more injurious
than beer. Wine, beer, and spirits principally owe
their strength to the alcohol they contain; indeed,
nearly <i>all</i> wines are <i>fortified</i> (as it is called) with
brandy. Brandy contains a large quantity of alcohol,
more than any other liquor, namely, 55.3 per cent. If,
therefore, you give wine, it is, in point of fact, giving
diluted brandy—diluted alcohol; and alcohol acts, unless
it be used as a medicine, and under skillful medical
advice, as a poison to a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>156. <i>Suppose a child suddenly to lose his appetite:
is any notice to be taken of it?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If he cannot eat well, depend upon it there is something
wrong about the system. If he be teething, let a
mother look well to his gums, and satisfy herself that
they do not require lancing. If they be red, hot, and
swollen, send for a medical man, that he may scarify
them. If his gums be not inflamed, and no tooth appears
near, let her look well to the state of his bowels;
let her ascertain that they be sufficiently opened, and
that the stools be of a proper consistence, color, and
smell. If they be neither the one nor the other, give a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1147'>1147</span>dose of aperient medicine, which will generally put all
to rights. If the gums be cool, and the bowels be
right, and his appetite continue bad, call in medical
aid.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child asking for something to eat is frequently, in
a severe illness, the first favorable symptom; we may
generally then prognosticate that all will soon be well
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a child refuse his food, neither coax nor tempt him
to eat: as food without an appetite will do him more
harm than it will do him good; it may produce either
sickness, bowel complaint, or fever. Depend upon it,
there is always a cause for a want of appetite;—perhaps
his stomach has been overworked, and requires repose;
or his bowels are loaded, and Nature wishes to take
time to use up the old material;—there might be fever
lurking in his system; Nature stops the supplies, and
thus endeavors, by not giving it food to work with, to
nip it in the bud;—there might be inflammation; food
would then be improper, as it would only add fuel to
the fire; let, therefore, the cause be either an overworked
stomach, overloaded bowels, fever, or inflammation,
food would be injurious. Kind Nature, if we
will but listen to her voice, will tell us when to eat
and when to refrain.</p>

<p class='c008'>157. <i>When a child is four or five years old, have you
any objection to his drinking tea?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Some parents are in the habit of giving their children
strong (and frequently green) tea. This practice is
most hurtful. It acts injuriously upon their delicate,
nervous system, and thus weakens their whole frame.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1148'>1148</span>If milk does not agree, a cup of very weak tea, that is
to say, water with a dash of <i>black</i> tea in it, with a
tablespoonful of cream, may be substituted for milk;
but a mother must never give tea where milk agrees.</p>

<p class='c008'>158. <i>Have you any objection to a child occasionally
having either cakes or sweetmeats?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I consider them as so much slow poison. Such
things both cloy and weaken the stomach, and thereby
take away the appetite, and thus debilitate the frame.
Moreover, “sweetmeats are colored with poisonous
pigments.” A mother, surely, is not aware that when
she is giving her child sugar confectionery she is, in
many cases, administering a deadly poison to him?
“We beg to direct the attention of our readers to the
Report of the Analytical Sanitary Commission, contained
in the <cite>Lancet</cite> of the present week,<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a> on the pigments
employed in coloring articles of sugar confectionery.
From this report it appears that metallic
pigments, of a highly dangerous and even poisonous
character, containing chromic acid, lead, copper, mercury,
and arsenic, are commonly used in the coloring
of such articles.”<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>If a child be never allowed to eat cakes and sweetmeats,
he will consider a piece of dry bread a luxury,
and will eat it with the greatest relish.</p>

<p class='c008'>159. <i>Is bakers’ or is home-made bread the most wholesome
for a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Bakers’ bread is certainly the lightest; and, if we
could depend upon its being unadulterated, would,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1149'>1149</span>from its lightness, be the most wholesome; but as we
cannot always depend upon bakers’ bread, home-made
bread, as a rule, should be preferred. If it be at all
heavy, a child must not be allowed to partake of it; a
baker’s loaf ought then to be sent for, and continued to
be eaten until light home-made bread can be procured.
Heavy bread is most indigestible. He must not be
allowed to eat bread, until it be two or three days old.
If it be a week old, in cold weather, it will be the more
wholesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>160. <i>Do you approve either of caraway seeds or of
currants in bread or in cakes—the former to disperse
wind, the later to open the bowels?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is nothing better than plain bread: the caraway
seeds generally pass through the bowels undigested,
and thus might irritate, and might produce,
instead of disperse wind.<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a> Some mothers put currants
in cakes, with a view of opening the bowels of their
children; but they only open them by disordering
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>161. <i>My child has an antipathy to certain articles
of diet: what would you advise to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A child’s antipathy to certain articles of diet should
be respected: it is a sin and a shame to force him to
eat what he has a great dislike to: a child, for instance,
sometimes dislikes the fat of meat, underdone meat, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1150'>1150</span>skin off boiled milk and off rice pudding. Why should
he not have his likes and dislikes as well as “children
of a larger growth?” Besides, there is an idiosyncrasy—a
peculiarity of the constitution in some children—and
Nature oftentimes especially points out what is good
and what is bad for them individually, and we are not
to fly in the face of Nature. “What is one man’s meat
is another man’s poison.” If a child be forced to eat
what he dislikes, it will most likely not only make him
sick, but will disorder his stomach and bowels: food, if
it is really to do him good, must be eaten by him with
a relish, and not with disgust and aversion. Some
mothers, who are strict disciplinarians, pride themselves
on compelling their children to eat whatever
they choose to give them! Such children are to be
pitied!</p>

<p class='c008'>162. <i>When ought a child to commence to dine with
his parents?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as he be old enough to sit up at the table,
provided the father and mother either dine or lunch in
the middle of the day. “I always prefer having children
about me at meal-times. I think it makes them little
gentlemen and gentlewomen in a manner that nothing
else will.”<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE NURSERY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>163. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the selection,
the ventilation, the warming, the temperature,
and the arrangements of a nursery? and have you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1151'>1151</span>any further observations to offer conducive to the well-doing
of my child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The nursery ought to be the largest and the most
airy room in the house. In the town, if it be in the
topmost story (provided the apartment be large and
airy) so much the better, as the air will then be purer.
The architect, in the building of a house, ought to be
particularly directed to pay attention to the space, the
loftiness, the ventilation, the light, the warming, and
the conveniences of a nursery. A bath-room attached
to it will be of great importance and benefit to the
health of a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will, also, be advantageous to have a water-closet
near at hand, which should be well supplied with water,
be well drained, and be well ventilated. If this be not
practicable, the evacuations ought to be removed as
soon as they are passed. It is a filthy and an idle
habit of a nurse-maid to allow a motion to remain for
any length of time in the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Ventilation</span> of a nursery is of paramount importance.
There ought to be a constant supply of fresh,
pure air in the apartment. But how few nurseries have
fresh, pure air? Many nurseries are nearly hermetically
sealed—the windows are seldom, if ever, opened; the
doors are religiously closed; and, in the summer time,
the chimneys are carefully stuffed up, so that a breath
of air is not allowed to enter! The consequences are,
the poor unfortunate children “are poisoned by their
own breaths,” and are made so delicate that they are
constantly catching cold; indeed, it might be said that
they are laboring under chronic catarrhs, all arising
from Nature’s laws being set at defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1152'>1152</span>The windows ought to be large, and should be made
to freely open both top and bottom. Whenever the
child is out of the nursery the windows ought to be
thrown wide open; indeed, when he is in it, if the
weather be fine, the upper sash should be a little lowered.
A child should be encouraged to change the
room frequently, in order that it may be freely ventilated;
for good air is as necessary to his health as
wholesome food, and air cannot be good if it be not
frequently changed. If you wish to have a strong and
healthy child, ponder over and follow this advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have to enter my protest against the use of a stove
in a nursery. I consider a gas stove <i>without a chimney</i>
to be an abomination, most destructive to human life.
There is nothing like the old-fashioned open fire-place,
with a good-sized chimney, so that it may not only
carry off the smoke, but also the impure air of the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Be sure to have a fire-guard around the grate, and
be strict in not allowing your child either to touch or
to play with fire; frightful accidents have occurred
from mothers and nurses being on these points lax.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nursery ought to have a large fire-guard, to go
all round the hearth, and which should be sufficiently
high to prevent a child from climbing over. Not only
must the nursery have a guard, but every room where
he is allowed to go should be furnished with one on
the bars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moreover, it will be necessary to have a guard in
every room where a fire is burning, to protect the ladies,
who, in accordance with the present fashion, wear such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1153'>1153</span>preposterous crinolines, and thus to prevent the frightful
deaths which are at the present time of such frequent
and startling occurrence; lady-burning is now
one of the institutions of our land!</p>

<p class='c008'>A nursery is usually kept too hot; the temperature
in the winter time ought <i>not to exceed</i> 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
A <i>good</i> thermometer should be considered an
indispensable requisite to a nursery. A child in a hot,
close nursery is bathed in perspiration; if he leave the
room to go to one of lower temperature, the pores of
his skin are suddenly closed, and either a severe cold,
or an inflammation of the lungs, or an attack of bronchitis,
is likely to ensue. Moreover, the child is both
weakened and enervated by the heat, and thus readily
falls a prey to disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child ought never to be permitted to sit with his
back to the fire; if he be allowed, it weakens his spine,
and thus his whole frame; it causes a rush of blood to
the head and face, and predisposes him to catch cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let a nurse make a point of opening the nursery
window every time that she and her little charge leave
the nursery, if their absence be only for half an hour.
The mother herself ought to see that this advice is followed,
pure air is so essential to the well-being of a
child. Pure air and pure water,<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a> and, let me add, pure
milk, are for a child the grand and principal requirements
of health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Look well to the <span class='sc'>Drainage</span> of your house and neighborhood.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1154'>1154</span>A child is very susceptible to the influence
of bad drainage. Bad drains are fruitful sources of
scarlet fever, of diphtheria, of diarrhœa, etc. “It is
sad to be reminded that, whatever evils threaten the
health of a population, whether from pollutions of water
or of air,—whether from bad drainage or overcrowding,
they fall heaviest on the most innocent victims—upon
children of tender years. Their delicate frames
are infinitely more sensitive than the hardened constitutions
of adults, and the breath of poison or the chill
of hardships easily blights their tender life.”<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>A nursery floor ought not to be <i>washed</i> oftener than
once a week; and then the child or children should,
until it be dry, be sent into another room. During the
drying of the floor, the windows must, of course, be
thrown <i>wide</i> open.</p>

<p class='c008'>The constant <i>wetting</i> of a nursery is a frequent
source of illness among children. The floor ought, of
course, to be kept clean; but this may be done by the
servant thoroughly sweeping the room out every morning
before her little charge makes his appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not have your nursery walls covered with <i>green</i>
paper-hangings. Green paper-hangings contain large
quantities of arsenic—arsenite of copper (Scheele’s
green)—which, I need scarcely say, is a virulent
poison, and which flies about the room in the form of
powder. There is frequently enough poison on the
walls of a room to destroy a whole neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is another great objection to having your nursery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1155'>1155</span>walls covered with <i>green</i> paper-hangings; if any
of the paper should become loose from the walls, a
little child is very apt to play with it, and to put it, as
he does everything else, to his mouth. This is not an
imaginary state of things, as four children in one family
have just lost their lives from sucking green paper-hangings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Green dresses, as they are colored with a preparation
of arsenic, are equally as dangerous as green
paper-hangings; a child ought, therefore, never to wear
a <i>green</i> dress. “It may be interesting to some of our
readers,” says <cite>Land and Water</cite>, “to know that the
new green, so fashionable for ladies’ dresses, is just
as dangerous in its nature as the green wall-paper,
about which so much was written some time since.
It is prepared with a large quantity of arsenic; and we
have been assured by several of the leading dressmakers
that the work-women employed in making up dresses of
this color are seriously affected with all the symptoms
of arsenical poison. Let our lady friends take care.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Children’s toys are frequently painted of a green
color with arsenite of copper, and are, consequently,
highly dangerous to play with. The best toy for a
child is a box of unpainted wooden bricks, which is a
constant source of amusement to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you have your nursery walls hung with paintings
and engravings, let them be of good quality. The horrid
daubs and bad engravings that usually disfigure
nursery walls, are enough to ruin the taste of a child,
and to make him take a disgust to drawing, which
would be a misfortune. A fine engraving and a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1156'>1156</span>painting expand and elevate his mind. We all know
that first impressions are the most vivid and the most
lasting. A taste in early life for everything refined
and beautiful purifies his mind, cultivates his intellect,
keeps him from low company, and makes him grow up
a gentleman!</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucifer matches, in case of sudden illness, should,
both in the nursery and in the bedroom, always be in
readiness; but they must be carefully placed out of the
reach of children, as lucifer matches are a deadly
poison.<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>164. <i>Have you any observation to make on the</i> <span class='fss'>LIGHT</span>
<i>of a nursery?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let the window, or, what is better, the windows, of
a nursery be very large, so as to thoroughly light up
every nook and corner of the room, as there is nothing
more conducive to the health of a child than an abundance
of light in the dwelling.</p>

<p class='c008'>A room cannot, then, be too light. The windows of
a nursery are generally too small. A child requires as
much light as a plant. Gardeners are well aware of the
great importance of light in the construction of their
greenhouses, and yet a child, who requires it as much,
and is of much greater importance, is cooped up in dark
rooms!</p>

<p class='c008'>The windows of a nursery ought not only to be
frequently opened to let in fresh air, <i>but should be frequently
cleaned</i>, to let in plenty of light and of sunshine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1157'>1157</span>as nothing is so cheering and beneficial to a child as
an abundance of light and sunshine!</p>

<p class='c008'><i>With regard to the best artificial light for a nursery.</i>—The
air of a nursery cannot be too pure; I
therefore do not advise you to have gas in it, as gas in
burning gives off quantities of carbonic acid and sulphuretted
hydrogen, which vitiate the air. There is
no better light for a nursery than either Price’s patent
candles or the old-fashioned tallow candle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let a child’s <i>home</i> be the happiest <i>house</i> to him in all
the world; and to be happy he must be merry, and all
around him should be merry and cheerful; and he ought
to have an abundance of playthings, to help on the
merriment.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he has a dismal nurse, and a dismal home, he may
as well be incarcerated in a prison, and be attended by
a jailer. It is sad enough to see dismal, doleful men
and women, but it is a truly lamentable and unnatural
sight to see a doleful child! The young ought to be
as playful and as full of innocent mischief as a kitten.
There will be quite time enough in after-years for sorrow
and for sadness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bright colors, plenty of light, <i>clean</i> windows (mind
this, if you please), an abundance of <i>good</i>-colored prints,
and toys without number, are the proper furnishings
of a nursery. Nursery! why, the very name tells you
what it ought to be—the home of childhood,—the most
important room in the house,—a room that will greatly
tend to stamp the character of your child for the remainder
of his life.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1158'>1158</span>165. <i>Have you any more hints to offer conducive to
the well-doing of my child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>You cannot be too particular in the choice of those
who are in constant attendance upon him. You yourself,
of course, must be his <i>head-nurse</i>—you only require
some one to take the drudgery off your hands!</p>

<p class='c008'>You ought to be particularly careful in the selection
of his nurse. She should be steady, lively, truthful,
and good-tempered; and must be free from any natural
imperfection, such as squinting, stammering, etc., for
a child is such an imitative creature that he is likely
to acquire that defect, which in the nurse is natural.
“Children, like babies, are quick at ‘taking notice.’
What they see they mark, and what they mark they
are very prone to copy.”<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>She ought not to be very young, or she may be thoughtless,
careless, and giggling. You have no right to set
a child to mind a child; it would be like the blind leading
the blind. No! a child is too precious a treasure
to be intrusted to the care and keeping of a young girl.
Many a child has been ruined for life by a careless
young nurse dropping him and injuring his spine.</p>

<p class='c008'>A nurse ought to be both strong and active, in order
that her little charge may have plenty of good nursing;
for it requires great strength in the arms to carry a
heavy child for the space of an hour or two, at a stretch,
in the open air; and such is absolutely necessary, and
is the only way to make him strong, and to cause him
to cut his teeth easily, and at the same time to regulate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1159'>1159</span>his bowels; a nurse, therefore, must be strong and
active, and not mind hard work, for hard work it is;
but after she is accustomed to it, pleasant notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never should a nurse be allowed to wear a mask, nor
to dress up and paint herself as a ghost, or as any other
frightful object. A child is naturally timid and full of
fears, and what would not make the slightest impression
upon a grown-up person, might throw a child into
fits—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“The sleeping, and the dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are but as pictures: ’tis the age of childhood</div>
      <div class='line'>That fears a painted devil.”<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Never should she be permitted to tell her little charge
frightful stories of ghosts and hobgoblins; if this be
allowed, the child’s disposition will become timid and
wavering, and may continue so for the remainder of
his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a little fellow were not terrified by such stories,
the darkness would not frighten him more than the
light. Moreover, the mind thus filled with fear, acts
upon the body, and injures the health. A child must
never be placed in a dark cellar, nor frightened by tales
of rats, etc. Instances are related of fear thus induced
impairing the intellect for life; and there are numerous
examples of sudden fright causing a dangerous and
even a fatal illness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Night-terrors.</i>—This frightening of a child by a silly
nurse frequently brings on night-terrors. He wakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1160'>1160</span>up suddenly, soon after going to sleep, frightened and
terrified; screaming violently, and declaring that he
has seen either some ghost, or thief, or some object that
the silly nurse had been previously in the day describing,
who is come for him to take him away. The little
fellow is the very picture of terror and alarm; he hides
his face in his mother’s bosom, the perspiration streams
down him, and it is some time before he can be pacified—when,
at length, he falls into a troubled, feverish
slumber, to awake in the morning unrefreshed. Night
after night these terrors harass him, until his health
materially suffers, and his young life becomes miserable,
looking forward with dread to the approach of darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment of night-terrors.</i>—If they have been
caused by the folly of the nurse, discharge her at once,
and be careful to select a more discreet one. When
the child retires to rest, leave a candle burning, and let
it burn all night; sit with him until he be asleep; and
take care, in case he should rouse up in one of his
night-terrors, that either you yourself or some kind
person be near at hand. Do not scold him for being
frightened—he cannot help it; but soothe him, calm
him, fondle him, take him into your arms, and let him
feel that he has some one to rest upon, to defend and
to protect him. It is frequently in these cases necessary
before he can be cured to let him have change of
air and change of scene. Let him live in the daytime,
a great part of the day, in the open air.</p>

<p class='c008'>A nurse-maid should never, on any account whatever,
be allowed to whip a child. “Does ever any
man or woman remember the feeling of being ‘whipped’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1161'>1161</span>as a child, the fierce anger, the insupportable ignominy,
the longing for revenge, which blotted out all thought
of contrition for the fault or rebellion against the punishment?
With this recollection on their own parts, I
can hardly suppose any parents venturing to inflict it,
much less allowing its infliction by another under any
circumstances whatever. A nurse-maid or domestic of
any sort, once discovered to have lifted up her hand
against a child, ought to meet instant severe rebuke,
and on a repetition of the offense instant dismissal.”<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I have seen in the winter time a lazy nurse sit before
the fire with a child on her lap, rubbing his cold feet
just before putting him to his bed. Now this is not
the way to warm his feet. The right method is to let
him romp and run either about the room, or the landing,
or the hall—this will effectually warm them; but,
of course, it will entail a little extra trouble on the
nurse, as she will have to use a little exertion to induce
him to do so, and this extra trouble a lazy nurse will
not relish. Warming the feet before the fire will give
the little fellow chilblains, and will make him when he
is in bed more chilly. The only way for him to have
a good romp before he goes to bed, is for the mother to
join in the game. She may rest assured, that if she
does so, her child will not be the only one to benefit by
it. She herself will find it of marvelous benefit to her
own health; it will warm her own feet, it will be
almost sure to insure her a good night, and will make
her feel so light and buoyant as almost to fancy that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1162'>1162</span>she is a girl again! Well, then, let every child, before
he retire to bed, hold a high court of revelry, let him
have an hour—the Children’s Hour—devoted to romp,
to dance, to riot, and to play, and let him be the master
of the revels—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Between the dark and the daylight,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When the night is beginning to lower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes a pause in the day’s occupation,</div>

<p class='c008'>Let a child be employed—take an interest in his
employment, let him fancy that he is useful—<i>and he is
useful</i>, he is laying in a stock of health. He is much
more usefully employed than many other grown-up
children are!</p>

<p class='c008'>A child should be happy; he must, in every way, be
made happy; everything ought to be done to conduce
to his happiness, to give him joy, gladness, and pleasure.
Happy he should be, as happy as the day is long.
Kindness should be lavished upon him. Make a child
understand that you love him; prove it in your actions—these
are better than words; look after his little
pleasures—join in his little sports; let him never hear
a morose word—it would rankle in his breast, take deep
root, and in due time bring forth bitter fruit. Love!
let love be his pole-star; let it be the guide and the
rule of all you do and all you say unto him. Let your
face, as well as your tongue, speak love. Let your
hands be ever ready to minister to his pleasures and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1163'>1163</span>his play. “Blessed be the hand that prepares a pleasure
for a child, for there is no saying when and where
it may again bloom forth. Does not almost everybody
remember some kind-hearted man who showed him a
kindness in the dulcet days of childhood? The writer
of this recollects himself, at this moment, a bare-footed
lad, standing at the wooden fence of a poor little garden
in his native village, while, with longing eyes, he
gazed on the flowers which were blooming there quietly
in the brightness of the Sabbath morning. The possessor
came from his little cottage. He was a woodcutter
by trade, and spent the whole week at work in
the woods. He had come into the garden to gather
flowers to stick in his coat when he went to church.
He saw the boy, and breaking off the most beautiful
of his carnations (it was streaked with red and white),
he gave it to him. Neither the giver nor the receiver
spoke a word, and with bounding steps the boy ran
home. And now, here, at a vast distance from that
home, after so many events of so many years, the feeling
of gratitude which agitated the breast of that boy,
expressed itself on paper. The carnation has long
since faded, but it now bloometh afresh.”<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The hearty ringing laugh of a child is sweet music
to the ear. There are three most joyous sounds in nature—the
hum of a bee, the purr of a cat, and the laugh
of a child. They tell of peace, of happiness, and of
contentment, and make one for awhile forget that there
is so much misery in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1164'>1164</span>A man who dislikes children is unnatural; he has
no “milk of human kindness” in him; he should be
shunned. Give me, for a friend, a man—</p>

<p class='c008'>Speak <i>gently</i> to a child; speak <i>gently</i> to all; but
more especially speak <i>gently</i> to a child. “A gentle
voice is an excellent thing in woman,” and is a jewel
of great price, and is one of the concomitants of a <i>perfect</i>
lady. Let the hinges of your disposition be well
oiled. “‘I have a dear friend. He was one of those
well-oiled dispositions which turn upon the hinges of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1166'>1166</span>the world without creaking.’ Would to heaven there
were more of them! How many there are who never
turn upon the hinges of this world without a grinding
that sets the teeth of a whole household on edge! And
somehow or other it has been the evil fate of many of
the best spirits to be so circumstanced; both men and
women, to whom life is ‘sweet habitude of being,’
which has gone far to reconcile them to solitude as far
less intolerable! To these especially the creakings of
those said rough hinges of the world is one continued
torture, for they are all too finely strung; and the oft-recurring
grind jars the whole sentient frame, mars
the beautiful lyre, and makes cruel discord in a soul of
music. How much of sadness there is in such thoughts!
Seems there not a Past in some lives to which it is
impossible ever to become reconciled?”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Pleasant words ought always to be spoken to a
child! there must be neither snarling, nor snapping,
nor snubbing, nor loud contention toward him. If
there be it will ruin his temper and disposition, and
will make him hard and harsh, morose and disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not be always telling your child how wicked he
is; what a naughty boy he is; that God will never
love him, and all the rest of such twaddle. Do not, in
point of fact, bully him, as many poor little fellows are
bullied! It will ruin him if you do; it will make him
in after-years either a coward or a tyrant. Such conversations,
like constant droppings of water, will make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1167'>1167</span>an impression, and will cause him to feel that it is of
no use to try to be good—that he is hopelessly wicked!
Instead of such language, give him confidence in himself;
rather find out his good points and dwell upon
them; praise him where and whenever you can; and
make him feel that, by perseverance and by God’s
blessing, he will make a good man. Speak truthfully
to your child; if you once deceive him, he will not
believe you for the future. Not only so, but if you are
truthful yourself you are likely to make him truthful—like
begets like. There is something beautiful in truth!
A lying child is an abomination! Sir Walter Scott
says “that he taught his son to ride, to shoot, and to
tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as a child can speak, he should be made to
lisp the noble words of truth, and to love it, and to
abhor a lie! What a beautiful character he will then
make! Blessed is that child who can say,—</p>

<p class='c008'>Let a child be nurtured in love. “It will be seen
that I hold this law of kindness as the Alpha and
Omega of education. I once asked one, in his own
house, a father in everything but the name, his authority
unquestioned, his least word held in reverence, his
smallest wish obeyed—‘How did you ever manage to
bring up these children?’ He said, ‘<i>By love!</i>’”<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Let every word and action prove that you love your
children. Enter into all their little pursuits and pleasures.
Join them in their play, and “be a child again!”
If they are curious, do not check their curiosity; but
rather encourage it; for they have a great deal—as we
all have—to learn, and how can they know if they are
not taught? You may depend upon it, the knowledge
they obtain from observation is far superior to that obtained
from books. Let all you teach them, let all you do,
and let all you say, bear the stamp of love. “Endeavor,
from first to last, in your intercourse with your children,
to let it bear the impress of <i>love</i>. It is not enough
that you <i>feel</i> affection toward your children—that you
are devoted to their interests; you must show in
your manner the fondness of your hearts toward them.
Young minds cannot appreciate great sacrifices made
for them; they judge their parents by the words and
deeds of everyday life. They are won by <i>little</i> kindnesses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1169'>1169</span>and alienated by <i>little</i> acts of neglect or impatience.
One complaint unnoticed, one appeal unheeded,
one lawful request arbitrarily refused, will be remembered
by your little ones more than a thousand acts of
the most devoted affection.”<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>A placid, well-regulated temper is very conducive to
health. A disordered or an overloaded stomach is a
frequent cause of peevishness. Appropriate treatment
in such a case will, of course, be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>167. <i>My child stammers: can you tell me the cause,
and can you suggest a remedy?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A child who stammers is generally “nervous,” quick,
and impulsive. His ideas flow too rapidly for speech.
He is “nervous:” hence, when he is alone, and with
those he loves, he oftentimes speaks fluently and well;
he stammers more both when he is tired, and when he
is out of health—when the nerves are either weak or
exhausted. He is emotional: when he is either in a
passion or in excitement, either of joy or of grief, he
can scarcely speak—“he stammers all over.” He is
impulsive: he often stammers in consequence. He is
in too great a hurry to bring out his words; they do
not flow in a proper sequence; hence his words are
broken and disjointed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stammering, of course, might be owing either to
some organic defect, such as from defective palate, or
from defective brain, then nothing will cure him; or it
might be owing to “nervous” causes—to “irregular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1170'>1170</span>nervous action,” then a cure might, with care and perseverance,
be usually effected.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all cases of stammering of a child, let both the
palate of his mouth and the bridle of his tongue be
carefully examined, to see that neither the palate be
defective, nor the bridle of the tongue be too short—that
he be not tongue-tied.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Now, with regard to Treatment.</i> Make him speak
slowly and deliberately; let him form each word, without
clipping or chopping; let him be made, when you
are alone with him, to exercise himself in elocution. If
he speak quickly, stop him in his mid-career, and make
him, quietly and deliberately, go through the sentence
again and again, until he has mastered the difficulty;
teach him to collect his thoughts, and to weigh each
word ere he give it utterance; practice him in singing
little hymns and songs for children; this you will find a
valuable help in the cure. A stammerer seldom stutters
when he sings. When he sings, he has a full knowledge
of the words, and is obliged to keep in time—to sing
neither too fast nor too slow. Besides, he sings in a
different key to his speaking voice. Many professors
for the treatment of stammering cure their patients by
practicing lessons of a sing-song character.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never jeer him for stammering, nor turn him to ridicule;
if you do, it will make him ten times worse; but
be patient and gentle with him, and endeavor to give
him confidence, and encourage him to speak to you as
quietly, as gently, and deliberately as you speak to
him; tell him not to speak until he has arranged his
thoughts and chosen his words; let him do nothing in
a hurry.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1171'>1171</span>Demosthenes was said, in his youth, to have stammered
fearfully, and to have cured himself by his own
prescription, namely, by putting a pebble in his mouth,
and declaiming, frequently, slowly, quietly, and deliberately,
on the sea-shore—the fishes alone being his
audience,—until, at length, he cured himself, and
charmed the world with his eloquence and with his
elocution. He is held up, to this very day, as the personification
and as the model of an orator. His patience,
perseverance, and practice ought, by all who
either are, or are interested in a stammerer, to be borne
in mind and followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>168. <i>Do you approve of a carpet in a nursery?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No; unless it be a small piece for the child to roll
upon. A carpet harbors dirt and dust, which dust is
constantly floating about the atmosphere, and thus
making it impure for him to breathe. The truth of
this may easily be ascertained by entering a darkened
room, where a ray of sunshine is struggling through a
crevice in the shutters. If the floor of a nursery must
be covered, let drugget be laid down; as this every
morning may be taken up and shaken. The less furniture
a nursery contains the better; for much furniture
obstructs the free circulation of the air, and, moreover,
prevents a child from taking proper exercise in the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>169. <i>Supposing there is not a fire in the nursery
grate, ought the chimney to be stopped to prevent a
draught in the room?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. I consider the use of a chimney to
be twofold: first, to carry off the smoke; and secondly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1172'>1172</span>(which is of quite as much importance), to ventilate the
room, by carrying off the impure air, loaded as it is
with carbonic acid gas, the refuse of respiration. The
chimney, therefore, should never, either winter or summer,
be allowed for one moment to be stopped. This
is important advice, and requires the strict supervision
of every mother, as servants will, if they have the
chance, stop all chimneys that have no fires in the
grates.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EXERCISE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>170. <i>Do you approve, during the summer months, of
sending a child out</i> <span class='fss'>BEFORE</span> <i>breakfast</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>I do, when the weather will permit, and provided
the wind be neither in an easterly nor in a northeasterly
direction: indeed, <i>he can scarcely be too much in the
open air</i>. He must not be allowed to stand about
draughts or about entries, and the only way to prevent
him doing so is for the mother herself to accompany
the nurse. She will then kill two birds with one stone,
as she will, by doing so, benefit her own as well as her
child’s health.</p>

<p class='c008'>171. <i>Ought a child to be early put on his feet to walk?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No: let him learn to walk himself. He ought to be
put upon a carpet; and it will be found that when he
is strong enough, he will hold by a chair, and will stand
alone: when he can do so, and attempts to walk, he
should then be supported. You must, on first putting
him upon his feet, be guided by his own wishes. He
will, as soon as he is strong enough to walk, have the
inclination to do so. When he has the inclination and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1173'>1173</span>the strength, it will be folly to restrain him; if he has
neither the inclination nor the strength, it will be absurd
to urge him on. Rely, therefore, to a certain extent,
upon the inclination of the child himself. Self-reliance
cannot be too early taught him, and, indeed,
every one else. In the generality of instances, however,
a child is put on his feet too soon, and the bones, at
that tender age, being very flexible, bend, causing
bowed and bandy legs; and the knees, being weak,
approximate too closely together, and thus they become
knock-kneed.</p>

<p class='c008'>This advice of <i>not</i> putting a child <i>early</i> on his feet, I
must strongly insist on, as so many mothers are so
ridiculously ambitious that their young ones should
walk early, that they should walk before other children
have attempted to do so, have frequently caused the
above lamentable deformities!</p>

<p class='c008'>172. <i>Do you approve of perambulators?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do not, for two reasons: first, because when a
child is strong enough, he had better walk as much as
he will; and, secondly, the motion is not so good, and
the muscles are not so much put into action, and consequently
cannot be so well developed, as when he is
carried. A perambulator is very apt to make a child
stoop, and to make him both crooked and round-shouldered.
He is cramped by being so long in one position.
It is painful to notice a babe a few months old in one
of these new-fangled carriages. His little head is bobbing
about, first on one side and then on the other—at
one moment it is dropping on his chest, the next it is
forcibly jolted behind: he looks, and doubtless feels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1174'>1174</span>wretched and uncomfortable. Again, these perambulators
are dangerous in crowded thoroughfares. They
are a public nuisance, inasmuch as they are wheeled
against and between people’s legs, and are a fruitful
source of the breaking of shins, of the spraining of ankles,
of the crushing of corns, and of the ruffling of the
tempers of the foot-passengers who unfortunately come
within their reach; while, in all probability, the gaping
nurses are staring another way, and every way indeed
but the right!</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides, in very cold weather, or in a very young
infant, the warmth of the nurse’s body, while he is being
carried, helps to keep him warm, he himself being
naturally cold. In point of fact, the child, while being
borne in the nurse’s arms, reposes on the nurse, warm
and supported as though he were in a nest! While,
on the other hand, if he be in a perambulator, he is cold
and unsupported, looking the very picture of misery,
seeking everywhere for rest and comfort, and finding
none!</p>

<p class='c008'>A nurse’s arm, then, is the only proper carriage for
a <i>young</i> child to take exercise on. She ought to change
about, first carrying him on the one arm, and then on
the other. Nursing him on one arm only might give
his body a twist on one side, and thus might cause deformity.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he is old enough to walk, and is able properly
to support the weight of his own neck and back, then
there will be no objection, provided it be not in a
crowded thoroughfare, to his riding occasionally in a
perambulator; but when he is older still, and can sit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1175'>1175</span>either a donkey or a pony, such exercise will be far
more beneficial, and will afford him much greater
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>173. <i>Supposing it to be wet under foot, but dry above,
do you then approve of sending a child out?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If the wind be neither in the east nor the northeast,
and if the air be not damp, let him be well wrapped up
and be sent out. If he be laboring under an inflammation
of the lungs, however slight, or if he be just
recovering from one, it would, of course, be highly improper.
In the management of a child, we must take
care neither to coddle nor to expose him unnecessarily,
as both are dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never send a child out to walk in a fog; he will, if
you do, be almost sure to catch cold. It would be much
safer to send him out in rain than in fog; though
neither the one nor the other would be desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>174. <i>How many times a day, in fine weather, ought
a child to be sent out?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let him be sent out as often as it be possible. If a
child lived more in the open air than he is wont to do,
he would neither be so susceptible of disease, nor would
he suffer so much from teething.</p>

<p class='c008'>175. <i>Supposing the day to be wet, what exercise
would you then recommend?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The child ought to run either about a large room or
about the hall; and, if it does not rain violently, you
should put on his hat and throw up the window, taking
care while the window is open that he does not stand
still.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not on any account allow him to sit any length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1176'>1176</span>of time at a table, amusing himself with books, etc.; let
him be acting and stirring, that his blood may freely
circulate as it ought to do, and that his muscles may
be well developed. I would rather see him actively
engaged in mischief, than sitting still, doing nothing.
He ought to be put on the carpet, and should then be
tumbled and rolled about, to make the blood bound
merrily through the vessels, to stir up the liver, to promote
digestion, and to open the bowels. The misfortune
of it is, the present race of nurses are so stuck
out with crinoline, that they are not able to stoop
properly, and thus to have a good game at romps with
their little charges.</p>

<p class='c008'>176. <i>Supposing it to be winter, and the weather to
be very cold, would you still send a child out?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Decidedly, provided he be well wrapped up. The
cold will brace and strengthen him. Cold weather is
the finest tonic in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>In frosty weather, the roads being slippery, when
you send him out to walk, put a pair of large, old
woolen stockings <i>over</i> his boots or shoes. This will
not only keep his feet and his legs warm, but it will
prevent him from falling down and hurting himself.
While thus equipped, he may even walk on a slide of
ice without falling down.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child, in the winter time, requires, to keep him
warm, plenty of flannel and plenty of food, plenty of
fresh and genuine milk, and plenty of water in his tub
to wash him in a morning, plenty of exercise and
plenty of play, and then he may brave the frosty air.
It is the coddled, the half-washed, and the half-starved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1177'>1177</span>child (half-washed and half-starved from either the
mother’s ignorance or from the mother’s timidity), that
is the chilly starveling,—catching cold at every breath
of wind, and every time he either walks or is carried
out,—a puny, skinny, scraggy, scare-crow, more dead
than alive, and more fit for his grave than for the rough
world he will have to struggle in!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>AMUSEMENTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>177. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the amusements
of a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let the amusements of a child be as much as possible
out of doors; let him spend the greater part of every
day in the open air; let him exert himself as much as
he pleases, his feelings will tell him when to rest and
when to begin again; let him be what Nature intended
him to be—a happy, laughing, joyous child. Do not
let him be always poring over books.</p>

<p class='c008'>He ought to be encouraged to engage in those sports
wherein the greatest number of muscles are brought
into play. For instance, to play at ball, or hoop, or
football, to play at horses, to run to certain distances
and back; and, if a girl, to amuse herself with a skipping-rope,
such being excellent exercise—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Every child, where it be practicable, should have a
small plot of ground to cultivate, that he may dig and
delve in, and make dirt-pies if he choose. Children,
nowadays, unfortunately, are not allowed to soil their
hands and their fine clothes. For my own part, I dislike
such model children; let a child be natural—let
him, as far as is possible, choose his own sports. Do
not be always interfering with his pursuits, and be
finding fault with him. Remember, what may be
amusing to you may be distasteful to him. I do not,
of course, mean but that you should constantly have a
watchful eye over him; yet do not let him see that he
is under restraint or surveillance; if you do, you will
never discover his true character and inclinations.
Not only so, but do not dim the bright sunshine of his
early life by constantly checking and thwarting him.
Tupper beautifully says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1179'>1179</span>“And check not a child in his merriment.—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Should not his morning be sunny?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When, therefore, he is either in the nursery or in the
play-ground, let him shout and riot and romp about as
much as he pleases. His lungs and his muscles want
developing, and his nerves require strengthening; and
how can such be accomplished unless you allow them
to be developed and strengthened by natural means?</p>

<p class='c008'>The nursery is a child’s own domain; it is his castle,
and he should be Lord Paramount therein. If he
choose to blow a whistle, or to spring a rattle, or to
make any other hideous noise, which to him is sweet
music, he should be allowed, without let or hinderance,
to do so. If any members of the family have weak
nerves, let them keep at a respectful distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child who never gets into mischief must be either
sly, or delicate, or idiotic; indeed, the system of many
persons in bringing up children is likely to make them
either the one or the other. The present plan of training
children is nearly all work (books), and very little
play. Play, and plenty of it, is necessary to the very
existence of a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>A boy not partial to mischief, innocent mischief, and
play, is unnatural; he is a man before his time, he is a
nuisance, he is disagreeable to himself and to every one
around. “A boy not fond of fun and frolic may possibly
make a tolerable man, but he is an intolerable boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Girls, at the present time, are made clever simpletons;
their brains are worked with useless knowledge,
which totally unfits them for everyday duties. Their
muscles are allowed to be idle, which makes them limp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1180'>1180</span>and flabby. The want of proper exercise ruins the
complexion, and their faces become of the color of a
tallow candle! And precious wives and mothers they
make when they do grow up! Grow up, did I say!
They grow all manner of ways, and are as crooked as
crooked sticks!</p>

<p class='c008'>What an unnatural thing it is to confine a child several
hours a day to his lessons; why, you might as well
put a colt in harness, and make him work for his living!
A child is made for play; his roguish little eye,
his lithe figure, his antics, and his drollery, all point
out that he is cut out for play—that it is as necessary
to his existence as the food he eats, and as the air he
breathes!</p>

<p class='c008'>A child ought not to be allowed to have playthings
with which he can injure either himself or others, such
as toy-swords, toy-cannons, toy-paint-boxes, knives,
bows and arrows, hammers, chisels, saws, etc. He
will not only be likely to injure himself and others, but
will make sad havoc on furniture, house, and other
property. Fun, frolic, and play ought, in all innocent
ways, to be encouraged; but willful mischief and dangerous
games ought, by every means, to be discountenanced.
This advice is frequently much needed,
as children prefer to have and delight in dangerous
toys, and often coax and persuade weak and indulgent
mothers to gratify their wishes.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Painted</i> toys are, many of them, highly dangerous,
those painted <i>green</i> especially, as the color generally
consists of Scheele’s green—arsenite of copper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children’s paint-boxes are very dangerous toys for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1181'>1181</span>child to play with: many of the paints are poisonous,
containing arsenic, lead, gamboge, etc., and a child,
when painting, is apt to put the brush into his mouth,
to absorb the superabundant fluid. Of all the colors,
the <i>green</i> paint is the most dangerous, as it is frequently
composed of arsenite of copper—arsenic and copper—two
deadly poisons.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are some paint-boxes warranted not to contain
a particle of poison of any kind: these ought, for a
child, to be chosen by a mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, remember, although he ought not to be allowed
to have poison paint-boxes and poison-painted toys, <i>he
must have an abundance of toys</i>, such as the white-wood
toys—brewers’ drays, millers’ wagons, boxes of wooden
bricks, etc. The Noah’s Ark is one of the most amusing
and instructive toys for a child. “Those fashioned
out of brown, unpainted pine-wood by the clever carvers
of Nuremberg or the Black Forest are the best, I
think, not only because they are the most spirited, but
because they will survive a good deal of knocking about,
and can be sucked with impunity. From the first dawn
of recollection, children are thus familiarized with the
forms of natural objects, and may be well up in natural
history before they have mastered the A B C.”<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Parents often make Sunday a day of gloom: to this
I much object. Of all the days in the week, Sunday
should be the most cheerful and pleasant. It is considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1182'>1182</span>by our Church a festival; and a glorious festival
it ought to be made, and one on which our Heavenly
Father wishes to see all His children happy and full of
innocent joy! Let Sunday, then, be made a cheerful,
joyous, innocently happy day, and not, as it frequently
is, the most miserable and dismal in the week. It is
my firm conviction that many men have been made
irreligious by the ridiculously strict and dismal way they
were compelled, as children, to spend their Sundays.
You can no more make children religious by gloomy
asceticism, than you can make people good by Act of
Parliament!</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the great follies of the present age is, children’s
parties, where they are allowed to be dressed
like grown-up women, stuck out in crinoline, and encouraged
to eat rich cake and pastry, and to drink
wine, and to sit up late at night! There is something
disgusting and demoralizing in all this. Their pure
minds are blighted by it. Do not let me be misunderstood:
there is not the least objection, but, on the contrary,
great advantage, for friends’ children to meet
friends’ children; but then let them be treated as children,
and not as men and women!</p>

<p class='c008'>178. <i>Do you approve of public play-grounds for
children?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It would be well, in every village, and in the outskirts
of every town, if a large plot of ground were
set apart for children to play in, and to go through
regular gymnastic exercises. Play is absolutely necessary
to a child’s very existence, as much as food and
sleep; but in many parts of England where is he to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1183'>1183</span>have it? Play-grounds and play are the best schools
we have; they teach a great deal not taught elsewhere;
they give lessons in health, which is the
grandest wealth that can be bestowed—“for health is
wealth;” they prepare the soil for the future school-master;
they clear the brain, and thus the intellect;
they strengthen the muscles; they make the blood
course merrily through the arteries; they bestow
healthy food for the lungs; they give an appetite;
they make a child, in due time, become every inch a
man! Play-grounds and play are one of the finest Institutions
we possess. What would our large public
schools be without their play and cricket-grounds?
They would be shorn of half their splendor and usefulness!</p>

<p class='c008'>There is so much talk nowadays about <i>useful</i>
knowledge, that the importance of play and play-grounds
is likely to be forgotten. I cannot help
thinking, however, that a better state of things is
dawning. “It seems to be found out that in our zeal
for useful knowledge, that knowledge is found to be
not the least useful which treats boys as active, stirring,
aspiring, and ready.”<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'>EDUCATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>179. <i>Do you approve of infant schools?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do, if the arrangements be such that health is preferred
before learning.<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a> Let children be only confined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1184'>1184</span>for three or four hours a day, and let what little they
learn be taught as an amusement rather than as a
labor. A play-ground ought to be attached to an
infants’ school; where, in fine weather, for every half
hour they spend in-doors, they should spend one in
the open air; and, in wet weather, they ought to have,
in lieu of the play-ground, a large room to romp, and
shout, and riot in. To develop the different organs,
muscles, and other parts of the body, children require
fresh air, a free use of their lungs, active exercise, and
their bodies to be thrown into all manner of attitudes.
Let a child mope in a corner, and he will become stupid
and sickly. The march of intellect, as it is called, or
rather the double quick march of intellect, as it should
be called, has stolen a march upon health. Only allow
the march of intellect and the march of health to take
equal strides, and then we shall have “<i><span lang="la">mens sana in
corpore sano</span></i>” (a sound mind in a sound body).</p>

<p class='c008'>In the education of a young child, it is better to instruct
him by illustration and by encouraging observation
on things around and about him, than by books.
It is surprising how much, without endangering the
health, may be taught in this way. In educating your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1185'>1185</span>child, be careful to instill and to form good habits—they
will then stick to him for life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children at the present day are too highly educated—their
brains are overtaxed, and thus weakened.
The consequence is, that as they grow up to manhood,
if they grow up at all, they become fools! <i>Children</i>
are now taught what formerly <i>youths</i> were taught.
The chord of a child’s life is ofttimes snapped asunder
in consequence of overeducation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Screw not the chord too sharply, lest it snap.”<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>You should treat a child as you would a young colt.
Think only at first of strengthening his body. Let him
have a perfectly free, happy life, plenty of food to eat,
abundance of air to breathe, and no work to do; there
is plenty of time to think of his learning—of giving him
brain work. It will come sadly too soon; but do not
make him old before his time.</p>

<p class='c008'>180. <i>At what age do you advise my child to begin his
course of education—to have his regular lessons?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>In the name of the prophet,—Figs! Fiddlesticks!
about courses of education and regular lessons for a
child! You may as well ask me when he, a child, is
to begin Hebrew, the Sanscrit, and Mathematics! Let
him have a course of education in play; let him go
through regular lessons in football, bandy, playing at
tic, hares and hounds, and such like excellent and really
useful and health-giving lessons. Begin his lessons!
Begin brainwork, and make an idiot of him! Oh! for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1186'>1186</span>shame, ye mothers! You who pretend to love your
children so much, and to tax, otherwise to injure, irreparably
to injure their brains, and thus their intellects
and their health, and to shorten their very days. And
all for what? To make prodigies of them! Forsooth!
to make fools of them in the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>181. <i>Well, then, as you have such a great objection
to a child commencing his education early in life, at
what age may he, with safety, commence his lessons?
and which do you prefer—home or school education?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Home is far preferable to a school education for a
child. If at home, he is under your own <i>immediate</i>
observation, and is not liable to be contaminated by
naughty children; for, in every school, there is necessarily
a great mixture of the good and of the bad; and
a child, unfortunately, is more likely to be led by a bad
than by a good child.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moreover, if the child be educated at home, the
mother can see that his brain be not overworked. At
school the brain is apt to be overworked, and the
stomach and the muscles to be underworked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember, as above stated, <i>the brain must have but
very little work until the child be seven years old</i>: impress
this advice upon your memory, and let no foolish
ambition to make your child a clever child allow you,
for one moment, to swerve from this advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Build up a strong, healthy body, and in due time
the brain will bear a <i>moderate</i> amount of intellectual
labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>As I have given <i>you</i> so much advice, permit me, for
one moment, to address a word to the father of your
child:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1187'>1187</span>Let me advise you, then, Mr. <i>Paterfamilias</i>, to be
careful how you converse, what language you use, while
in the company of your child. Bear in mind, a child
is very observant, and thinks much, weighs well, and
seldom forgets all you say and all you do? Let no
hasty word, then, and more especially no oath, or no
impious language, ever pass your lips, if your child is
within hearing. It is, of course, at all times wicked to
swear; but it is heinously and unpardonably sinful to
swear in the presence of your child! “Childhood is
like a mirror, catching and reflecting images. One impious
or profane thought, uttered by a parent’s lip, may
operate upon the young heart like a careless spray of
water thrown upon polished steel, staining it with
rust, which no after-scouring can efface.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Never talk secrets before a child—“little pitchers
have long ears;” if you do, and he disclose your secrets,—as
most likely he will,—and thus make mischief,
it will be cruel to scold him; you will, for your imprudence,
have yourself only to blame. Be most careful,
then, in the presence of your child, of what you say and
of whom you speak. This advice, if followed, might
save a great deal of annoyance and vexation.</p>

<p class='c008'>182. <i>Are you an advocate for a child being taught
singing?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I am; I consider singing a part of a child’s education.
Singing expands the walls of the chest, strengthens
and invigorates the lungs, gives sweetness to the voice,
improves the pronunciation, and is a great pleasure
and amusement to a child.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1188'>1188</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>SLEEP.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>183. <i>Do you approve of a child sleeping on a</i> <span class='fss'>FEATHER</span>
<i>bed</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>feather</i> bed enervates his body, and, if he be so
predisposed, causes rickets, and makes him crooked. A
horse-hair mattress is the best for a child to lie on. The
pillow, too, should be made of horse-hair. A <i>feather</i>
pillow often causes the head to be bathed in perspiration,
thus enervating the child and making him liable
to catch cold. If he be at all rickety, if he be weak in
the neck, if he be inclined to stoop, or if he be at all
crooked, let him, by all means, lie without a pillow.</p>

<p class='c008'>184. <i>Do you recommend a child, in the middle of the
day, to be put to sleep?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let him be put on his mattress <i>awake</i> at twelve
o’clock, that he may sleep for an hour or two before
dinner, then he will rise both refreshed and strengthened
for the remainder of the day. I said, let him be
put down <i>awake</i>. He might, for the first few times,
cry; but, by perseverance, he will without any difficulty
fall to sleep. The practice of sleeping before dinner
ought to be continued until he be two years old, and if
he can be prevailed upon, even longer. For if he do
not have sleep in the middle of the day, he will all the
afternoon and the evening be cross; and when he does
go to bed, he will probably be too tired to sleep, or his
nerves, having been exhausted by the long wakefulness,
he will fall into a troubled, broken slumber, and not
into that sweet, soft, gentle repose, so characteristic of
healthy, happy childhood!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1189'>1189</span>185. <i>At what hour ought a child to be put to bed in
the evening?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>At six in the winter, and at seven o’clock in the summer.
<i>Regularity</i> ought to be observed, as <i>regularity
is very conducive to health</i>. It is a reprehensible practice
to keep a child up until nine or ten o’clock at night.
If this be done, he will, before his time, become old,
and the seeds of disease will be sown.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as he can run, let him be encouraged, for
half an hour before he goes to bed, to race either about
the hall, or the landing, or a large room, which will be
the best means of warming his feet, of preventing chilblains,
and of making him sleep soundly.</p>

<p class='c008'>186. <i>Have you any directions to give me as to the
placing of my child in his bed?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If a child lie alone, place him fairly on his side in the
middle of the bed; if it be winter time, see that his
arms and hands be covered with the bedclothes; if it
be summer, his hands might be allowed to be outside
the clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In putting him down to sleep, you should ascertain
that his face be not covered with the bedclothes; if it
be, he will be poisoned with his own breath—the breath
constantly giving off carbonic acid gas; which gas must,
if his face be smothered in the clothes, be breathed—carbonic
acid gas being highly poisonous.</p>

<p class='c008'>You can readily prove the existence of carbonic acid
gas in the breathing, by simply breathing into a little
lime-water; after breathing for a few seconds into it,
a white film will form on the top; the carbonic acid
gas from the breath unites with the lime of the lime-water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1190'>1190</span>and the product of the white film is carbonate
of lime.</p>

<p class='c008'>187. <i>Do you advise a bedroom to be darkened at
night?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly. A child sleeps sounder and sweeter in
a dark than in a light room. There is nothing better,
for the purpose of darkening a bed room, than Venetian
blinds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember, then, a well-ventilated, but a darkened
chamber at night. The cot or the crib ought <i>not</i> to
face the window, “as the light is best behind.”<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>188. <i>Which is the best position for a child when
sleeping—on his back, or on his side?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>His side. He ought to be accustomed to change
about—on the right side one night, on the left another;
and occasionally, for a change, he should lie on his
back. By adopting this plan you will not only improve
his figure, but likewise his health. Lying, night
after night, in one position, would be likely to make
him crooked.</p>

<p class='c008'>189. <i>Do you advise, in the winter time, that there
should be a fire in the night nursery?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not, unless the weather be intensely cold.
I dislike fires in bedrooms, especially for children; they
are very enervating, and make a child liable to catch
cold. Cold weather is very bracing, particularly at
night. “Generally speaking,” says the <cite><span lang="fr">Siècle</span></cite>, “during
winter, apartments are too much heated. The temperature
in them ought not to exceed 16° Centigrade
(59° Fahrenheit); and even in periods of great cold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1191'>1191</span>scientific men declare that 12° or 14° had better not be
exceeded. In the wards of hospitals, and in the chambers
of the sick, care is taken not to have greater heat
than 15°. Clerks in offices, and other persons of sedentary
occupations, when the rooms in which they sit are
too much heated, are liable to cerebral [brain] congestion
and to pulmonary [lung] complaints. In bedrooms,
and particularly those of children, the temperature
ought to be maintained rather low; it is even
prudent only rarely to make fires in them, especially
during the night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If a cold stable make a healthy horse,” I am quite
sure that a moderately cold and well-ventilated bedroom
helps to make a healthy child. But still, in the
winter time, if the weather be biting cold, a <i>little</i> fire
in the bedroom grate is desirable. In bringing up
children, we must never run into extremes—the coddling
system and the hardening system are both to be
deprecated; the coddling system will make a strong
child weakly, while the hardening system will probably
kill a delicate one.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child’s bed ought, of course, to be comfortably
clothed with blankets—I say blankets, as they are
much superior to coverlids; the perspiration will more
readily pass through a blanket than a coverlid. A
<i>thick</i> coverlid ought never to be used; there is nothing
better for a child’s bed than the old-fashioned patchwork
coverlid, as the perspiration will easily escape
through it.</p>

<p class='c008'>190. <i>Should a child be washed and dressed</i> <span class='fss'>AS SOON
AS HE AWAKES</span> <i>in the morning</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1192'>1192</span>He ought, if he awakes in anything like reasonable
time; for if he doze after he be once awake, such
slumber does him more harm than good. He should
be up every morning as soon as it is light. If, as a
child, he be taught to rise early, it will make him an
early riser for life, and will tend greatly to prolong
both his existence and his happiness.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Never awake a child from his sleep</i> to dress him, to
give him medicine, or for any other purpose; <i>let him
always sleep as long as he can</i>; but the moment he
awakes let him be held out, and then let him be washed
and dressed, and do not wait, as many a silly nurse
does, until he has wet his bed, until his blood be chilled,
and until he be cross, miserable, and uncomfortable!
How many babies are made ill by such foolish practices!</p>

<p class='c008'>The moment he leaves his bed, turn back to the
fullest extent the clothes, in order that they may be
thoroughly ventilated and sweetened. They ought to
be exposed to the air for at least an hour before the
bed be made. As soon as he leaves his room, be it
winter or summer, throw open the windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>191. <i>Ought a child to lie alone?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He should after he is weaned. He will rest more
comfortably, and his sleep will be more refreshing.</p>

<p class='c008'>192. <i>Supposing a child should not sleep well, what
ought to be done? Would you give him a dose of composing
medicine?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. Try the effects of exercise. Exercise
in the open air is the best composing medicine in the
world. Let the little fellow be well tired out, and
there will be little fear of his not sleeping.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1193'>1193</span>193. <i>Have you any further observations to make on
the subject of sleep?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Send a child joyful to bed. Do not, if you can possibly
help it, let him go to bed crying. Let the last
impressions he has at night be of his happy home, and
of his loving father and mother, and let his last thoughts
be those of joy and gladness. He will sleep all the
sounder if he be sent to bed in such a frame of mind,
and he will be more refreshed and nourished in the
morning by his sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>194. <i>What is the usual cause of a child walking in
his sleep, and what measures, during such times, ought
to be adopted to prevent his injuring himself?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A disordered stomach in a child of nervous temperament
is usually the cause. The means to be adopted
to prevent his throwing himself out of the window are
to have bars to his chamber casement, and if that be
not practicable, to have either nails or screws driven
into the window-sash to allow the window to open only
for a sufficient space for ventilation, and to have a screw
window-fastening, in order that he cannot, without
difficulty, open the window; to have a trusty person to
sleep in his room, who should have directions given not
to rouse him from his sleep, but to gently lead him back
to his bed, which may frequently be done without
awaking him; and to consult a medical man, who will
adopt means to put his stomach into order, to brace his
nerves, and to strengthen his general system. A trip
to the coast and sea bathing, in such a case, is often of
great service.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'>SECOND DENTITION.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>195. <i>When does a child begin to cut his</i> <span class='fss'>SECOND</span> <i>set
of teeth</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>Generally at seven years old. He <i>begins</i> to <i>cut</i> them
at about that time; but it should be borne in mind (so
wonderful are the works of God) that the <i>second</i> crop
of teeth <i>in embryo</i> is actually bred and formed from
the very commencement of his life, <i>under</i> the first tier
of teeth, but which remain in abeyance for years, and
do not come into play until the <i>first</i> teeth, having done
their duty, loosen and fall out, and thus make room for
<i>the</i> more numerous, larger, stronger, and more permanent
teeth, which latter have to last for the remainder
of his existence. The <i>first</i> set is sometimes cut with
a great deal of difficulty, and produces various disease;
the <i>second</i>, or permanent teeth, come easily, and are
unaccompanied with any disorder. The following is
the process: one after another of the <i>first</i> set gradually
loosen, and either drop out, or with little pain are
readily pulled out; under these, the <i>second</i>—the permanent
teeth—make their appearance, and fill up the
vacant spaces. The fang of the tooth that has dropped
out is nearly all absorbed or eaten away, leaving little
more than the crown. The <i>first</i> set consists of twenty;
the <i>second</i> (including the wise teeth, which are not
generally cut until after the age of twenty-seven) consists
of thirty-two.</p>

<p class='c008'>I would recommend you to pay particular attention
to the teeth of your children; for, besides their being
ornamental, their regularity and soundness are of great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1195'>1195</span>importance to the present as well as to the future health
of your offspring. If there be any irregularity in the
appearance of the <i>second</i> set, lose no time in consulting
an experienced and respectable dentist.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DISEASE, <span class='sc'>Etc.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>196. <i>Do you think it important that I should be made
acquainted with the symptoms of the</i> <span class='fss'>SERIOUS</span> <i>diseases
of children</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly. I am not advocating the doctrine of a
mother <i>treating serious</i> diseases; far from it; it is not
her province, except in certain cases of extreme urgency
where a medical man cannot be procured, and where
delay might be death; but I do insist upon the necessity
of her knowing the <i>symptoms</i> of disease. My belief
is, that if parents were better informed on such subjects,
many children’s lives might be saved, much
suffering might be averted, and much sorrow might be
spared. The fact is, the knowledge of the symptoms
of disease is, to a mother, almost a sealed book. If she
were better acquainted with these matters, how much
more useful would she be in a sick-room, and how much
more readily would she enter into the plans and views
of the medical man! By her knowledge of the symptoms,
and by having his advice in time, she would nip disease
in the bud, and the fight might end in favor of life, for
“sickness is just a fight between life and death.”<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>It is really lamentable to contemplate the amount of
ignorance that still exists among mothers in all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1196'>1196</span>appertains to the diseases of children; although, fortunately,
they are beginning to see and to feel the importance
of gaining instruction on such subjects; but the
light is only dawning. A writer of the present day
makes the following remarks, which somewhat bear on
the subject in question. He observes: “In spite of
the knowledge and clear views possessed by the profession
on all that concerns the management of children,
no fact is more palpable than that the most grievous
ignorance and incompetency prevail respecting it among
the public. We want some means of making popular
the knowledge which is now almost restricted to medical
men, or at most, to the well-educated classes.”<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In the earlier editions of this work, I did not give
the <i>treatment</i> of any serious diseases, however urgent.
In the three last editions I have been induced, for
reasons I will presently state, to give the <i>treatment</i> of
some of the more urgent <i>serious</i> diseases, when a medical
man cannot instantly be procured, and where delay
might be death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Charles Locock, who has taken a kind interest
in this little work, has given me valid reasons why a
mother should be so enlightened. The following extracts
are from a letter which I received from Sir
Charles on the subject, and which he has courteously
allowed me to publish. He says: “As an old physician
of some experience in complaints of infants and
children, I may perhaps be allowed to suggest that in
a future edition you should add a few words on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1197'>1197</span>actual treatment of some of the more urgent infantile
diseases. It is very right to caution parents against
superseding the doctor, and attempting to manage
serious illness themselves; but your advice, with very
small exceptions, always being ‘to lose no time in sending
for a medical man,’ much valuable and often irremediable
time may be lost <i>when a medical man is not
to be had</i>. Take, for instance, a case of croup: there
are no directions given at all, except to send for a
medical man, and always to keep medicines in the house
which he may have directed. But how can this apply
to a first attack? You state that a first attack is generally
the worst. But why is it so? Simply because
it often occurs when the parents do not recognize it,
and it is allowed to get to a worse point than in subsequent
attacks, when they are thoroughly alive to it.
As the very best remedy, and often the only essential
one, if given early, is a full emetic, surely it is better
that you should give some directions as to this in a
future edition, and I can speak from my own experience
when I say that an emetic, <i>given in time</i>, and repeated
to free vomiting, will cut short <i>any</i> case of croup. In
nine cases out of ten the attack takes place in the evening
or early night, and when vomiting is effected the
dinner of that day is brought up nearly undigested, and
the severity of the symptoms at once cut short. Whenever
any remedy is valuable, the more by its being
administered <i>in time</i>, it is surely wiser to give directions
as to its use, although, as a general rule, it is much
better to advise the sending for medical advice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The above reasons, coming from such a learned and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1198'>1198</span>experienced physician as Sir Charles Locock, are conclusive,
and have decided me to comply with his
advice, to enlighten a mother on the <i>treatment</i> of some
of the more urgent diseases of infants and of children.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a subsequent letter addressed to myself, Sir
Charles has given me the names of those <i>urgent</i> diseases
which he considers may be treated by a mother,
“where a medical man cannot be procured quickly, or
not at all;” they are—Croup; Inflammation of the
Lungs; Diphtheria; Dysentery; Diarrhœa; Hooping-cough,
in its various stages; and Shivering Fit. Sir
Charles sums up his letter to me by saying: “Such a
book ought to be made as complete as possible, and the
objections to medical treatment being so explained as
to induce mothers to try to avoid medical men is not
so serious as that of leaving them without any guide
in those instances where every delay is dangerous, and
yet where medical assistance is not to be obtained or
not to be had quickly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to the above, I shall give you the <i>treatment</i>
of Bronchitis, Measles, and Scarlet Fever. Bronchitis
is one of the most common diseases incidental to
childhood, and, with judicious treatment, is, in the
absence of the medical man, readily managed by a
sensible mother. Measles is very submissive to treatment.
Scarlet Fever, <i>if it be not malignant</i>, and if
certain rules be strictly followed, is also equally amenable
to treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been fortunate in treating Scarlet Fever, and
therefore think it desirable to enter fully into the <i>treatment</i>
of a disease, which is looked upon by many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1199'>1199</span>parents, and according to the usual mode of treatment,
with just cause, with great consternation and dread.
By giving my plan of treatment fully and simply,
and without the slightest reservation, I am fully persuaded,
through God’s blessing, that I may be the
humble means of saving the lives of numbers of children.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diseases that might be treated by a mother, in
the absence of a medical, man, will form the subject of
future Conversations.</p>

<p class='c008'>197. <i>At what age does Water on the Brain usually
occur, and how is a mother to know that her child is
about to labor under that disease?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Water on the brain is, as a rule, a disease of childhood;
after a child is seven years old it is comparatively
rare. It more frequently attacks delicate children—children
who have been dry-nursed (especially if
they have been improperly fed), or who have been
suckled too long, or who have had consumptive mothers,
or who have suffered severely from teething, or who
are naturally of a feeble constitution. Water on the
brain sometimes follows an attack of inflammation of
the lungs, more especially if depressing measures (such
as excessive leeching and the administration of emetic
tartar) have been adopted. It occasionally follows in
the train of contagious eruptive diseases, such as either
small-pox or scarlatina. We may divide the symptoms
of water on the brain into two stages. The first—the
premonitory stage—which lasts four or five days, in
which medical aid might be of great avail; the second—the
stage of drowsiness and of coma—which usually
ends in death.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1200'>1200</span>I shall dwell on the first—the premonitory stage—in
order that a mother may see the importance without
loss of time of calling in a medical man:</p>

<p class='c008'>If her child be feverish and irritable, if his stomach
be disordered, if he have urgent vomitings, if he have
a foul breath, if his appetite be capricious and bad, if
his nights be disturbed (screaming out in his sleep), if
his bowels be disordered, more especially if they be
constipated, if he be more than usually excited, if his
eye gleam with unusual brilliancy, if his tongue ran
faster than it is wont, if his cheek be flushed and his
head be hot, and if he be constantly putting his hand
to his head, there is cause for suspicion. If to these
symptoms be added, a more than usual carelessness in
tumbling about, in hitching his foot in the carpet, or
in dragging one foot after the other; if, too, he has
complained of darting, shooting, lancinating pains in
his head, it may then be known that the <i>first</i> stage of
inflammation (the forerunner of water on the brain)
either has taken or is about taking place. Remember,
no time ought to be lost in obtaining medical aid; for
the <i>commencement</i> of the disease is the golden opportunity,
when life might probably be saved.</p>

<p class='c008'>198. <i>At what age, and in what neighborhood, is a
child most liable to Croup, and when is a mother to
know that it is about to take place?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is unusual for a child until he be twelve months
old to have croup; but, from that time until the age
of two years, he is more liable to it than at any other
period. The liability after two years gradually, until
he be ten years old, lessens, after which time it is rare.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1201'>1201</span>A child is more liable to croup in a low and damp,
than in a high and dry neighborhood; indeed, in some
situations, croup is almost an unknown disease; while
in others it is only too well understood. Croup is more
likely to prevail when the wind is either easterly or
northeasterly.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no disease that requires more prompt treatment
than croup, and none that creeps on more insidiously.
The child at first seems to be laboring under
a slight cold, and is troubled with a little <i>dry</i> cough;
he is hot and fretful, and <i>hoarse</i> when he cries. Hoarseness
is one of the earliest symptoms of croup; and it
should be borne in mind that a young child, unless he
be going to have croup, is seldom hoarse; if, therefore,
your child be hoarse, he should be carefully watched,
in order that, as soon as croup be detected, not a
moment be lost in applying the proper remedies.</p>

<p class='c008'>His voice at length becomes gruff, he breathes as
though it were through muslin, and the cough becomes
crowing. These three symptoms prove that the disease
is now fully formed. These latter symptoms sometimes
come on without any previous warning, the little
fellow going to bed apparently quite well, until the
mother is awakened, perplexed, and frightened, in the
middle of the night, by finding him laboring under the
characteristic cough and the other symptoms of croup.
If she delay either to send for assistance, <i>or if proper
medicines be not instantly given</i>, in a few hours it will
probably be of no avail, and in a day or two the little
sufferer will be a corpse!</p>

<p class='c008'>When once a child has had croup the after-attacks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1202'>1202</span>are generally milder. If he has once had an attack of
croup, I should advise you always to have in the house
medicine—a 4 oz. bottle of ipecacuanha wine, to fly to
at a moment’s notice;<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a> but never omit, where practicable,
in a case of croup, whether the attack be severe
or mild, to send <i>immediately</i> for medical aid. There
is no disease in which time is more precious than in
croup, and where the delay of an hour may decide
either for life or for death.</p>

<p class='c008'>199. <i>But suppose a medical man is not</i> <span class='fss'>IMMEDIATELY</span>
<i>to be procured, what then am I to do? more especially,
as you say, that delay might be death.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—I never in my life lost a child with
croup where I was called in at the <i>commencement</i> of
the disease, and where my plans were carried out to
the very letter. Let me begin by saying, Look well
to the goodness and purity of the medicine, for the life
of your child may depend upon the medicine being
genuine. What medicine? <i>Ipecacuanha wine!</i> At
the earliest dawn of the disease give a teaspoonful of
ipecacuanha wine every five minutes, until free vomiting
be excited. In croup, before he is safe, free vomiting
<i>must</i> be established, and that without loss of time.
If, after the expiration of an hour, the ipecacuanha
wine (having given during that hour a teaspoonful of
it every five minutes) is not sufficiently powerful for
the purpose—although it generally is so (if the ipecacuanha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1203'>1203</span>wine be good)—then let the following mixture
be substituted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powdered Ipecacuanha, one scruple;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Wine of Ipecacuanha, one ounce and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Make a Mixture. A teaspoonful to be given every five minutes,
until free vomiting be excited, first <i>well</i> shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the vomiting, place the child for a quarter of
an hour in a warm bath.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a> When out of the bath give
him small doses of ipecacuanha wine every two or
three hours. The following is a palatable form for the
mixture:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Wine of Ipecacuanha, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, six drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Make a Mixture. A teaspoonful to be taken every two or three
hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>But remember, the emetic which is given at <i>first</i> is
<i>pure ipecacuanha wine, without a drop of either
water or of syrup</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A large sponge dipped out of very hot water, and
applied to the throat, and frequently renewed, oftentimes
affords great relief in croup, and ought during
the time the emetic is being administered in all cases
to be adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it be a <i>severe</i> case of croup, and does not in the
course of two hours yield to the free exhibition of the
ipecacuanha emetic, apply a narrow strip of <i>Smith’s
tela vesicatoria</i> to the throat, prepared in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1204'>1204</span>way as for a case of inflammation of the lungs (see the
Conversation on the <i>treatment</i> of inflammation of the
lungs). With this only difference, let it be a narrower
strip, only one-half the width there recommended, and
apply it to the throat instead of to the chest. If a
child has a very short, fat neck, there may not be room
for the <i>tela</i>, then you ought to apply it to the <i>upper</i>
part of the chest—just under the collar bones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let it be understood that the <i>tela vesicatoria</i> is
not a severe remedy, that the <i>tela</i> produces very little
pain—not nearly so much as the application of leeches;
although, in its action, it is much more beneficial, and
is not nearly so weakening to the system.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keep the child from all stimulants; let him live on a
low diet, such as milk and water, toast and water,
arrow-root, etc.; and let the room be, if practicable, at
a temperate heat—60° Fahrenheit, and be well ventilated.</p>

<p class='c008'>So you see that the <i>treatment</i> of croup is very simple,
and that the plan might be carried out by an intelligent
mother. Notwithstanding which, it is your duty,
where practicable, to send at the very <i>onset</i> of the
disease for a medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me again reiterate that if your child is to be saved
the <i>ipecacuanha wine must be genuine and good</i>.
This can only be effected by having the medicine from
a highly respectable chemist. Again, if ever your child
has had croup, let me again urge you <i>always</i> to have
in the house a 4 oz. bottle of ipecacuanha wine, that
you may resort to at a moment’s notice in case there
be the slightest return of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1205'>1205</span>Ipecacuanha wine, unfortunately, is not a medicine
that keeps well; therefore, every three or four months
a fresh bottle ought to be procured either from a medical
man or from a chemist. As long as the ipecacuanha
wine remains <i>clear</i>, it is good; but as soon as it becomes
<i>turbid</i> it is bad, and ought to be replaced by a fresh
supply.</p>

<p class='c008'>An intelligent correspondent of mine makes the following
valuable remarks on the preservation of ipecacuanha
wine: “Now, I know that there are some
medicines and chemical preparations which, though
they spoil rapidly when at all exposed to the air, yet
will keep perfectly good for an indefinite time if hermetically
sealed up in a <i>perfectly full</i> bottle. If so,
would it not be a valuable suggestion if the Apothecaries’
Hall, or some other London firm of <i>undoubted</i>
reliability, would put up 1 oz. phials of ipecacuanha
wine of guaranteed purity, sealed up so as to keep
good so long as unopened, and sent out in sealed
packages, with the guarantee of their name. By keeping
a few such ounce bottles in an unopened state in
one’s house, one might rely on being ready for any
emergency. If you think this suggestion worth notice,
and could induce some first-rate house to carry it
out, and mention the fact in a subsequent edition of
your book, you would, I think, be adding another most
valuable item to an already invaluable book.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The above suggestion of preserving ipecacuanha
wine in ounce bottles, quite full, and hermetically
sealed, is a very good one. The best way of hermetically
sealing the bottle would be to cut the cork level
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1206'>1206</span>with the lip of the bottle, and to cover the cork with
sealing-wax, in the same manner wine merchants serve
some kinds of their wines, and then to lay the bottles
on their sides in sawdust in the cellar. I have no
doubt, if such a plan were adopted, the ipecacuanha
wine would for a length of time keep good. Of course,
if the wine of ipecacuanha be procured from the
Apothecaries’ Hall Company, London (as suggested
by my correspondent), there can be no question as to
the genuineness of the article.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do.</i>—Do not give emetic tartar; do not
apply leeches; do not keep the room very warm; do
not give stimulants; do not omit to have always in
the house either a 4 oz. bottle, or three or four 1 oz.
bottles of ipecacuanha wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>200. <i>I have heard Child-crowing mentioned as a
formidable disease; would you describe the symptoms?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Child-crowing, or <i>spurious croup</i>, as it is sometimes
called, is occasionally mistaken for <i>genuine croup</i>. It
is a more frequent disorder than the latter, and requires
a different plan of treatment. Child-crowing is a disease
that almost invariably occurs only during dentition,
and is <i>most perilous</i>. But if a child laboring
under it can fortunately escape suffocation until he has
cut the whole of his first set of teeth—twenty—he is
then, as a rule, safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Child-crowing comes on in paroxysms. The breathing
during the intervals is quite natural—indeed, the
child appears perfectly well; hence the dangerous nature
of the disease is either overlooked, or is lightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1207'>1207</span>thought of, until perhaps a paroxysm worse than common
takes place, and the little patient dies of suffocation,
overwhelming the mother with terror, with confusion,
and dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>symptoms</i> in a paroxysm of child-crowing are
as follows: The child suddenly loses and fights for his
breath, and in doing so makes a noise very much like
that of crowing; hence the name child-crowing. The
face during the paroxysm becomes bluish or livid. In
a favorable case, after either a few seconds, or even, in
some instances, a minute, and a frightful struggle to
breathe, he regains his breath, and is, until another
paroxysm occurs, perfectly well. In an unfavorable
case, the upper part (chink) of the windpipe remains
for a minute or two closed, and the child, not being
able to breathe, drops a corpse in his nurse’s arms.
Many children, who are said to have died of fits, have
really died of child-crowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have entered thus rather fully into the subject, as
many lives might be saved if a mother knew the nature
of the complaint, and the <i>great necessity, during
the paroxysms, of prompt and proper measures</i>. For,
too frequently, before a medical man has had time to
arrive, the child has breathed his last, the parent herself
being perfectly ignorant of the necessary treatment;
hence the vital importance of the subject, and
the paramount necessity of imparting information, in
a <i>popular</i> style, in a work of this kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>201. <i>What treatment, then, during a paroxysm of
Child-crowing should you advise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The first thing, of course, to be done is to send <i>immediately</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1208'>1208</span>for a medical man. Have a plentiful supply
of cold and of hot water always at hand, ready at a
moment’s notice for use. The instant the paroxysm is
upon the child, plentifully and perseveringly dash <i>cold</i>
water upon his head and face. Put his feet and legs
in <i>hot</i> salt, mustard, and water; and, if necessary,
place him up to his neck in a hot bath, still dashing
water upon his face and head. If he does not quickly
come round, sharply smack his back and buttocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as a medical man arrives, he will lose no
time in thoroughly lancing the gums and in applying
other appropriate remedies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Great care and attention ought, during the intervals,
to be paid to the diet. If the child is breathing a
smoky, close atmosphere, he should be immediately removed
to a pure one. In this disease, indeed, there is
no remedy equal to a change of air—to a dry, bracing
neighborhood. Change of air, even if it be winter, is
the best remedy, either to the coast or to a healthy
farm-house. I am indebted to Mr. Roberton, of Manchester
(who has paid great attention to this disease,
and who has written a valuable essay on the subject<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a>),
for the knowledge of this fact. Where, in a case of
this kind, it is not practicable to send a child <i>from</i>
home, then let him be sent out of doors the greater
part of every day; let him, in point of fact, almost
live in the open air. I am quite sure, from an extensive
experience, that in this disease, fresh air, and plenty of
it, is the best and principal remedy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1209'>1209</span>202. <i>When is a mother to know that a cough is not
a “tooth-cough,” but one of the symptoms of Inflammation
of the Lungs?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If the child has had a shivering fit; if his skin be
very hot and very dry; if his lips be parched; if there
be great thirst; if his cheeks be flushed; if he be dull
and heavy, wishing to be quiet in his cot or crib; if his
appetite be diminished; if his tongue be furred; if his
mouth be <i>burning</i> hot and dry;<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a> if his urine be scanty
and high-colored, staining the napkin or the linen; <i>if
his breathing be short, panting, hurried, and oppressed;
if there be a hard, dry cough; and if his skin be burning
hot</i>; then there is no doubt that inflammation of
the lungs has taken place.</p>

<p class='c008'>No time should be lost in sending for medical aid;
indeed, the <i>hot, dry mouth and skin, and short hurried
breathing</i> would be sufficient cause for your procuring
<i>immediate</i> assistance. If inflammation of the lungs
were properly treated at the <i>onset</i>, a child would
scarcely ever be lost by that disease. I say this advisedly,
for in my own practice, <i>provided I am called
in early, and if my plans are strictly carried out</i>, I
scarcely ever lose a child from inflammation of the
lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>You may ask—What are your plans? I will tell
you, in case <i>you cannot promptly obtain medical advice</i>,
as delay might be death.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1210'>1210</span><i>The treatment of Inflammation of the Lungs, what to
do.</i>—Keep the child to one room, to his bedroom, and
to his bed. Let the chamber be properly ventilated.
If the weather be cool, let a small fire be in the grate;
otherwise, he is better without a fire. Let him live on
low diet, such as weak black tea, milk and water, and
toast and water, thin oatmeal gruel, arrow-root, and
such like simple beverages, and give him the following
mixture:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Wine of Ipecacuanha, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in17'>Simple Syrup, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in9'>Water, six drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Make a Mixture. A teaspoonful of the mixture to be taken every
four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Be careful that you go to a respectable chemist, in
order <i>that the quality of the ipecacuanha wine may be
good, as the child’s life may depend upon it</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the medicine produces sickness, so much the
better; continue it regularly until the short, oppressed,
and hurried breathing has subsided, and has
become natural.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the attack be very severe, in addition to the above
medicine, at once apply a blister, not the common
blister, but <i>Smith’s tela vesicatoria</i>—a quarter of a
sheet, which ought to be fastened on to a piece of sticking-plaster,
taking care to apply the tela vesicatoria
(which is on paper) to the warmed plaster, so as to
securely fasten the tela vesicatoria on the sticking-plaster.
The plaster should be rather larger than the
blister, so as to leave a margin. Any respectable
chemist will understand the above directions, and will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1211'>1211</span>prepare the tela ready for use. If the child be a year
old, the blister ought to be kept on for three hours, and
then a piece of dry, soft linen rag should be applied for
another three hours. At the end of which time—six
hours—there will be a beautiful blister, which must
then, with a pair of scissors, be cut, to let out the
water; and then let the blister be dressed, night and
morning, with simple cerate spread on lint.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the little patient be more than one year, say two
years old, let the tela remain on for five hours, and the
dry linen rag for five hours more, before the blister, as
above recommended, be cut and dressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>If in a day or two the inflammation still continue
violent, let another tela vesicatoria be applied, not
over the old blister, but let a narrow slip of it, on
sticking-plaster, be applied on each side of the old
blister, and managed in the same manner as before
directed.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>I cannot speak too highly of Smith’s tela vesicatoria.</i>
It has, in my hands, through God’s blessing, saved the
lives of scores of children. It is far, very far superior
to the old-fashioned blistering plaster. It seldom, if
the above rules be strictly observed, fails to rise; it
gives much less pain than the common blister; when
it has had the desired effect, it readily heals, which
cannot always be said of the common fly-blister, more
especially with children.</p>

<p class='c008'>My sheet-anchors, then, in the inflammation of the
lungs of children, are, ipecacuanha wine and Smith’s
<i>tela vesicatoria</i>. Let the greatest care, as I before advised,
be observed in obtaining the ipecacuanha wine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1212'>1212</span>genuine and good. This can only be depended upon
by having the medicine from a highly respectable
chemist. Ipecacuanha wine, when genuine and good,
is, in many children’s diseases, one of the most valuable
of medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What, in a case of Inflammation of the Lungs</i>, <span class='fss'>NOT</span>
<i>to do</i>.—Do not, on any account, apply leeches. They
draw out the life of the child, but not his disease.
Avoid—<i>emphatically let me say so</i>—giving emetic
tartar. It is one of the most lowering and death-dealing
medicines that can be administered either to
an infant or to a child! If you wish to try the effect
of it, take a dose yourself, and I am quite sure that
you will then never be inclined to poison a baby with
such an abominable preparation! In olden times—many,
many years ago—I myself gave it in inflammation
of the lungs, and lost many children! Since leaving
it off, the recoveries of patients by the ipecacuanha
treatment, combined with the external application of
Smith’s <i>tela vesicatoria</i>, have been in many cases marvelous.
Avoid broths and wine, and all stimulants.
Do <i>not</i> put the child into a warm bath, it only oppresses
the already oppressed breathing. Moreover,
after he is out of the bath, it causes a larger quantity
of blood to rush back to the lungs and to the bronchial
tubes, and thus feeds the inflammation. Do not, by a
large fire, keep the temperature of the room high. A
small fire, in the winter time, encourages ventilation,
and in such a case does good. When the little patient
is on the mother’s or on the nurse’s lap, do not burden
him either with a <i>heavy</i> blanket or with a <i>thick</i> shawl.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1213'>1213</span>Either a child’s <i>thin</i> blanket, or a thin <i>woolen</i> shawl,
in addition to his usual night-gown, is all the clothing
necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>203. <i>Is Bronchitis a more frequent disease than
Inflammation of the Lungs? Which is the most dangerous?
What are the symptoms of Bronchitis?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Bronchitis is a much more frequent disease than
inflammation of the lungs; indeed, it is one of the most
common complaints both of infants and of children,
while inflammation of the lungs is comparatively a
rare disease. Bronchitis is not nearly such a dangerous
disease as inflammation of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The symptoms.</i>—The child for the first few days
labors under symptoms of a heavy cold; he has not
his usual spirits. In two or three days, instead of the
cold leaving him, it becomes more confirmed; he is
now really poorly, fretful, and feverish; his breathing
becomes rather hurried and oppressed; his cough is
hard and dry and loud; he wheezes, and if you put
your ear to his naked back, between his shoulder-blades,
you will hear the wheezing more distinctly. If
at the breast, he does not suck with his usual avidity;
the cough, notwithstanding the breast is a great comfort
to him, compels him frequently to loose the nipple;
his urine is scanty, and rather high-colored, staining
the napkin, and smelling strongly. He is generally
worse at night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, then, remember if the child be feverish, if he
have symptoms of a heavy cold, if he have an oppression
of breathing, if he wheeze, and if he have a tight,
dry, noisy cough, you may be satisfied that he has an
attack of bronchitis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1214'>1214</span>204. <i>How can I distinguish between Bronchitis and
Inflammation of the Lungs?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>In bronchitis the skin is warm but moist; in inflammation
of the lungs it is hot and dry: in bronchitis the
mouth is warmer than usual, but moist; in inflammation
of the lungs it is burning hot: in bronchitis the
breathing is rather hurried, and attended with wheezing;
in inflammation of the lungs it is very short and
panting, and is unaccompanied with wheezing, although
occasionally a very slight crackling sound might be
heard: in bronchitis the cough is long and noisy; in
inflammation of the lungs it is short and feeble: in
bronchitis the child is cross and fretful; in inflammation
of the lungs he is dull and heavy, and his countenance
denotes distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have sometimes a combination of bronchitis and
of inflammation of the lungs, an attack of the latter
following the former. Then the symptoms will be
modified, and will partake of the character of the two
diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>205. <i>How would you treat a case of Bronchitis?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If a medical man cannot be procured, I will tell you
<i>what to do</i>: Confine the child to his bedroom, and if
very ill, to his bed. If it be winter time, have a little
fire in the grate, but be sure that the temperature of
the chamber is not above 60° Fahrenheit, and let the
room be properly ventilated, which may be effected by
occasionally leaving the door a little ajar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let him lie either <i>outside</i> the bed or on a sofa; if he
be very ill, <i>inside</i> the bed, with a sheet and a blanket
only to cover him, but no thick coverlid. If he be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1215'>1215</span>allowed to lie on the lap, it only heats him and makes
him restless. If he will not lie on the bed, let him rest
on a pillow placed on the lap; the pillow will cause
him to lie cooler, and will more comfortably rest his
wearied body. If he be at the breast, keep him to it;
let him have no artificial food, unless, if he be thirsty,
a little toast and water. If he be weaned, let him have
either milk and water, arrow-root made with equal
parts of milk and water, toast and water, barley-water,
or weak black, tea, with plenty of new milk in it, etc.;
but, until the inflammation has subsided, neither broth
nor beef-tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, with regard to medicine, the best medicine is
ipecacuanha wine, given in large doses, so as to produce
constant nausea. The ipecacuanha abates fever,
acts on the skin, loosens the cough, and, in point of
fact, in the majority of cases will rapidly effect a cure.
I have in a preceding Conversation<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a> given you a prescription
for the ipecacuanha wine mixture. Let a teaspoonful
of the mixture be taken every four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>If in a day or two he be no better, but worse, by all
means continue the mixture, whether it produce sickness
or otherwise; and put on the chest a <i>tela vesicatoria</i>,
prepared and applied as I recommended when
treating of inflammation of the lungs.<a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The ipecacuanha wine and the tela vesicatoria are
my sheet-anchors in the bronchitis, both of infants and
of children. They rarely, even in very severe cases,
fail to effect a cure, provided the tela vesicatoria be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1216'>1216</span>properly applied, and the ipecacuanha wine be genuine
and of good quality.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there be any difficulty in procuring <i>good</i> ipecacuanha
wine, the ipecacuanha may be given in powder
instead of the wine. The following is a pleasant
form:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powder of Ipecacuanha, twelve grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>White Sugar, thirty-six grains:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix well together, and divide into twelve powders. One of the
powders to be put dry on the tongue every four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ipecacuanha powder will keep better than the
wine, an important consideration to those living in
country places; nevertheless, if the wine can be procured
fresh and good, I far prefer the wine to the
powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the bronchitis has disappeared, the diet ought
gradually to be improved—rice, sago, tapioca, and light
batter pudding, etc.; and in a few days, either a little
chicken or a mutton-chop, mixed with a well-mashed
potato and crumb of bread, should be given. But let
the improvement in his diet be gradual, or the inflammation
might return.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not apply leeches. Do not
give either emetic tartar, or antimonial wine, which is
emetic tartar dissolved in wine. Do not administer
either paregoric or syrup of poppies, either of which
would stop the cough, and would thus prevent the expulsion
of the phlegm. Any fool can stop a cough,
but it requires a wise man to rectify the mischief. A
cough is an effort of nature to bring up the phlegm,
which would otherwise accumulate, and in the end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1217'>1217</span>cause death. Again, therefore, let me urge upon you
the immense importance of <i>not</i> stopping the cough of
a child. The ipecacuanha wine will, by loosening the
phlegm, loosen the cough, which is the only right way
to get rid of a cough. Let what I have now said be
impressed deeply upon your memory, as thousands
of children in England are annually destroyed by
having their coughs stopped. Avoid, until the bronchitis
be relieved, giving him broths, and meat, and
stimulants of all kinds. For further observations on
<i>what</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i> in bronchitis, I beg to refer you to a
previous Conversation we had on <i>what</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i> in inflammation
of the lungs. That which is injurious in
the one case is equally so in the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>206. <i>What are the symptoms of Diphtheria, or, as it
is sometimes called, Boulogne sore-throat?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This terrible disease, although by many considered
to be a new complaint, is, in point of fact, of very ancient
origin. Homer, and Hippocrates, the father of
physic, have both described it. Diphtheria first appeared
in England in the beginning of the year 1857,
since which time it has never totally left our shores.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The symptoms.</i>—The little patient, before the disease
really shows itself, feels poorly, and is “out of
sorts.” A shivering fit, though not severe, may generally
be noticed. There is heaviness, and slight headache,
principally over the eyes. Sometimes, but not
always, there is a mild attack of delirium at night.
The next day he complains of slight difficulty of swallowing.
If old enough, he will complain of constriction
about the swallow. On examining the throat the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1218'>1218</span>tonsils will be found to be swollen and redder—more
darkly red than usual. Slight specks will be noticed
on the tonsils. In a day or two an exudation will
cover them, the back of the swallow, the palate, the
tongue, and sometimes the inside of the cheeks and
the nostrils. This exudation of lymph gradually increases
until it becomes a regular membrane, which
puts on the appearance of leather; hence its name
diphtheria. This membrane peels off in pieces; and
if the child be old and strong enough he will sometimes
spit it up in quantities, the membrane again and
again rapidly forming as before. The discharges from
the throat are occasionally, but not always offensive.
There is danger of croup from the extension of the
membrane into the windpipe. The glands about the
neck and under the jaw are generally much swollen;
the skin is rather cold and clammy; the urine is
scanty and usually pale; the bowels at first are frequently
relaxed. This diarrhœa may or may not cease
as the disease advances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The child is now in a perilous condition, and it becomes
a battle between his constitution and the disease.
If, unfortunately, as is too often the case—diphtheria
being more likely to attack the weakly—the
child be very delicate, there is but slight hope of recovery.
The danger of the disease is not always to
be measured by the state of the throat. Sometimes,
when the patient appears to be getting well, a sudden
change for the worse rapidly carries him off. Hence
the importance of great caution, in such cases, in
giving an opinion as to ultimate recovery. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1219'>1219</span>said enough to prove the terrible nature of the disease,
and to show the necessity of calling in, at the earliest
period of the symptoms, an experienced and skillful
medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>207. <i>Is Diphtheria contagious?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>Decidedly.</i> Therefore, when practicable, the rest of
the children ought instantly to be removed to a distance.
I say <i>children</i>, for it is emphatically a disease
of childhood. When adults have it, it is the exception,
and not the rule. “Thus it will be seen, in the
account given of the Boulogne epidemic, that of 366
deaths from this cause, 341 occurred among children
under ten years of age. In the Lincolnshire epidemic,
in the autumn of 1858, all the deaths at Horncastle,
25 in number, occurred among children under twelve
years of age.”<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>208. <i>What are the causes of Diphtheria?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Bad and imperfect drainage;<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a> want of ventilation;
overflowing privies; low neighborhoods in the vicinity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1220'>1220</span>of rivers; stagnant waters; indeed, everything that
vitiates the air and thus depresses the system, more
especially if the weather be close and muggy; poor
and improper food; and last, though not least, contagion.
Bear in mind, too, that a delicate child is much
more predisposed to the disease than a strong one.</p>

<p class='c008'>209. <i>What is the treatment of Diphtheria?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—Examine well into the ventilation, for
as diphtheria is frequently caused by deficient ventilation,
the best remedy is thorough ventilation. Look
well both to the drains and to the privies, and see
that the drains from the water-closets and from the
privies do not in any way contaminate the pump-water.
If the drains be defective or the privies be full, the
disease in your child will be generated, fed, and fostered.
Not only so, but the disease will spread in
your family and all around you.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keep the child to his bedroom and to his bed. For
the first two or three days, while the fever runs high,
put him on a low diet, such as milk, tea, arrow-root, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apply to his throat every four hours a warm barm
and oatmeal poultice. If he be old enough to have the
knowledge to use a gargle, the following will be found
serviceable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powdered Alum, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, seven ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Gargle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best medicine for the first few days of the attack,
is one of the following mixtures:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1221'>1221</span>Take of—Chlorate of Potash, two drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Boiling Water, seven ounces and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Syrup of Red Poppy, half an ounce:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. A tablespoonful to be taken every four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Diluted Sulphuric Acid, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, one ounce and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Infusion of Roses,<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a> four ounces and a half;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. A tablespoonful to be given every four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the skin has lost its preternatural heat,
beef-tea and chicken broth ought to be given. Or if
great prostration should supervene, in addition to the
beef-tea, port wine, a tablespoonful every four hours,
should be administered. If the child be cold, and there
be great sinking of the vital powers, brandy and water
should be substituted for the port wine. Remember,
in ordinary cases, port wine and brandy are not necessary,
<i>but in cases of extreme exhaustion</i> they are most
valuable.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the great heat of the skin has abated and
the debility has set in, one of the following mixtures
will be found useful:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Wine of Iron, one ounce and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, three ounces and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. A tablespoonful to be taken every four hours.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1222'>1222</span>Or,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Muriated Tincture of Iron, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, three ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. A tablespoonful to be taken three times
a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the disease should travel downward, it will cause
all the symptoms of croup, then it must be treated as
croup; with this only difference, that a blister (<i>tela
vesicatoria</i>) must <i>not</i> be applied, or the blistered surface
may be attacked by the membrane of diphtheria,
which may either cause death or hasten that catastrophe.
In every other respect treat the case as croup, by
giving an emetic, a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha wine
every five minutes, until free vomiting be excited, and
then administer smaller doses of ipecacuanha wine
every two or three hours, as I recommended when conversing
with you on the treatment of croup.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='sc'>Not</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not, on any account, apply
either leeches or a blister. If the latter be applied, it
is almost sure to be covered with the membrane of
diphtheria, similar to that inside of the mouth and of
the throat, which would be a serious complication.
Do not give either calomel or emetic tartar. Do not
depress the system by aperients, for diphtheria is an
awfully depressing complaint of itself; the patient, in
point of fact, is laboring under the depressing effects of
poison, for the blood has been poisoned either by the
drinking water being contaminated by fecal matter
from either a privy or from a water-closet; by some
horrid drain; by proximity to a pig-sty; by an overflowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1223'>1223</span>privy, especially if vegetable matter be rotting
at the same time in it; by bad ventilation, or by contagion.
Diphtheria may generally be traced either to
the one or to the other of the above causes; therefore
let me urgently entreat you to look well into all these
matters, and thus to stay the pestilence! Diphtheria
might long remain in a neighborhood if active measures
be not used to exterminate it.</p>

<p class='c008'>210. <i>Have the goodness to describe the symptoms of
Measles?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Measles commences with symptoms of a common
cold; the patient is at first chilly, then hot and feverish;
he has a running at the nose, sneezing, watering
and redness of the eyes, headache, drowsiness, a
hoarse and peculiar ringing cough, which nurses call
“measle-cough,” and difficulty of breathing. These
symptoms usually last three days before the eruption
appears; on the fourth it (the eruption) generally
makes its appearance, and continues for four days and
then disappears, lasting altogether, from the commencement
of the symptoms of cold to the decline of the eruption,
seven days. It is important to bear in mind that
the eruption consists of <i>crescent-shaped—half-moon-shaped—patches</i>;
that they usually appear first about
the face and the neck, in which places they are the best
marked; then on the body and on the arms; and,
lastly, on the legs, and that they are slightly raised
above the surface of the skin. The face is swollen,
more especially the eyelids, which are sometimes for
a few days closed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, then, remember, <i>the running at the nose, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1224'>1224</span>sneezing, the peculiar hoarse cough, and the half-moon-shaped
patches</i>, are the leading features of the
disease, and point out for a certainty that it is measles.</p>

<p class='c008'>211. <i>What constitutes the principal danger in
Measles?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The affection of the chest. The mucous or lining
membrane of the bronchial tubes is always more or
less inflamed, and the lungs themselves are sometimes
affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>212. <i>Do you recommend “surfeit water” and saffron
tea to throw out the eruption in Measles?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. The only way to throw out the
eruption, as it is called, is to keep the body comfortably
warm, and to give the beverages ordered by the
medical man, with the chill off. “Surfeit water,” saffron
tea, and remedies of that class, are hot and stimulating.
The only effect they can have, will be to increase
the fever and the inflammation—to add fuel to
the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>213. <i>What is the treatment of Measles?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—The child ought to be confined both to
his room and to his bed, the room being kept comfortably
warm; therefore, if it be winter time, there should
be a small fire in the grate; in the summer time, a fire
would be improper. The child must not be exposed
to draughts; notwithstanding, from time to time, the
door ought to be left a little ajar in order to change
the air of the apartment; for proper ventilation, let
the disease be what it may, is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let the child, for the first few days, be kept on a
low diet, such as on milk and water, arrow-root, bread
and butter, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1225'>1225</span>If the attack be mild, that is to say, if the breathing
be not much affected (for in measles it always is more
or less affected), and if there be not much wheezing,
the acidulated infusion of roses’ mixture<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a> will be all
that is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>But suppose that the breathing is short, and that
there is a great wheezing, then, instead of giving him
the mixture just advised, give him a teaspoonful of a
mixture composed of ipecacuanha wine, syrup, and
water,<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a> every four hours. And if, on the following
day, the breathing and the wheezing be not relieved,
in addition to the ipecacuanha mixture, apply a tela
vesicatoria, as advised under the head of inflammation
of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the child is convalescing, batter puddings,
rice, and sago puddings, in addition to the milk, bread
and butter, etc., should be given; and, a few days
later, chicken, mutton-chops, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The child ought not, even in a mild case of measles,
and in favorable weather, to be allowed to leave the
house under a fortnight, or it might bring on an attack
of bronchitis.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not give either “surfeit water”
or wine. Do not apply leeches to the chest. Do not
expose the child to the cold air. Do not keep the bedroom
very hot, but comfortably warm. Do not let the
child leave the house, even under favorable circumstances,
under a fortnight. Do not, while the eruption
is out, give aperients. Do not, “to ease the cough,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1226'>1226</span>administer either emetic tartar or paregoric—the former
drug is awfully depressing; the latter will stop the
cough, and will thus prevent the expulsion of the
phlegm.</p>

<p class='c008'>214. <i>What is the difference between Scarlatina and
Scarlet Fever?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>They are, indeed, one and the same disease, scarlatina
being the Latin for scarlet fever. But, in a
<i>popular</i> sense, when the disease is mild, it is usually
called scarlatina. The latter term does not sound so
formidable to the ears either of patients or of parents.</p>

<p class='c008'>215. <i>Will you describe the symptoms of Scarlet
Fever?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The patient is generally chilly, languid, drowsy,
feverish, and poorly for two days before the eruption
appears. At the end of the second day, the characteristic,
bright scarlet efflorescence, somewhat similar to
the color of a boiled lobster, usually first shows itself.
The scarlet appearance is not confined to the skin; but
the tongue, the throat, and the whites of the eyes put
on the same appearance; with this only difference, that
on the tongue and on the throat the scarlet is much
darker; and, as Dr. Elliotson accurately describes it,—“the
tongue looks as if it had been slightly sprinkled
with Cayenne pepper.” The eruption usually declines
on the fifth, and is generally indistinct on the sixth
day; on the seventh it has completely faded away.
There is usually, after the first few days, great itching
on the surface of the body. The skin, at the end of
the week, begins to peel and to dust off, making it look
as though meal had been sprinkled upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1227'>1227</span>There are three forms of scarlet fever,—the one
where the throat is <i>little</i>, if at all affected, and this is a
mild form of the disease; the second, which is generally,
especially at night, attended with delirium,
where the throat is <i>much</i> affected, being often greatly
inflamed and ulcerated; and the third (which is, except
in certain unhealthy districts, comparatively rare, and
which is <span class='fss'>VERY</span> dangerous), the malignant form.</p>

<p class='c008'>216. <i>Would it be well to give a little cooling, opening
physic as soon as a child begins to sicken for
Scarlet Fever?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>On no account whatever.</i> Aperient medicines are,
in my opinion, highly improper and dangerous both
before and during the period of the eruption. It is my
firm conviction that the administration of opening
medicine, at such times, is one of the principal causes
of scarlet fever being so frequently fatal. This is, of
course, more applicable to the poor, and to those who
are unable to procure a skillful medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>217. <i>What constitutes the principal danger in
Scarlet Fever?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The affection of the throat, the administration of
opening medicine during the first ten days, and a peculiar
disease of the kidneys ending in <i>anasarca</i> (dropsy),
on which account, the medical man ought, when practicable,
to be sent for at the onset, that no time may be
lost in applying <i>proper</i> remedies.</p>

<p class='c008'>218. <i>How would you distinguish between Scarlet
Fever and Measles?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Measles commences with symptoms of a common
cold; scarlet fever does not. Measles has a <i>peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1228'>1228</span>hoarse</i> cough; scarlet fever has not. The eruption of
measles is in patches of a half-moon shape, and is
slightly raised above the skin; the eruption of scarlet
fever is <i>not</i> raised above the skin at all, and is one continued
mass. The color of the eruption is much more
vivid in scarlet fever than in measles. The chest is the
part principally affected in measles, and the throat in
scarlet fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is an excellent method of determining, for a
certainty, whether the eruption be that of scarlatina or
otherwise. I myself have, in several instances, ascertained
the truth of it: “For several years M. Bouchut
has remarked in the eruption of scarlatina a curious
phenomenon, which serves to distinguish this eruption
from that of measles, erythema, erysipelas, etc., a phenomenon
essentially vital, and which is connected with
the excessive contractability of the capillaries. The
phenomenon in question is a <i>white line</i>, which can be
produced at pleasure by drawing the back of the nail
along the skin where the eruption is situated. On
drawing the nail, or the extremity of a hard body (such
as a pen-holder), along the eruption, the skin is observed
to grow pale, and to present a white trace, which
remains for one or two minutes, or longer, and then
disappears. In this way the diagnosis of the disease
may be very distinctly written on the skin; the word
‘Scarlatina’ disappears as the eruption regains its
uniform tint.”<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1229'>1229</span>219. <i>Is it of so much importance, then, to distinguish
between Scarlet Fever and Measles?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is of great importance, as in measles the patient
ought to be kept <i>moderately</i> warm, and the drinks
should be given with the chill off; while in scarlet
fever the patient ought to be kept cool—indeed, for the
first few days, <i>cold</i>; and the beverages, such as spring
water, toast and water, etc., should be administered
quite cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>220. <i>What is the treatment of Scarlet Fever?</i><a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—Pray pay particular attention to my
rules, and carry out my directions to the very letter—as
I can then promise you <i>that if the scarlet fever be
not malignant</i>, the plan I am about to recommend will,
with God’s blessing, be generally successful.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is the first thing to be done? Send the child
to bed; throw open the windows, be it winter or summer,
and have a thorough ventilation; for the bedroom
must be kept cool, I may say cold. Do not be afraid
of fresh air, for fresh air, for the first few days, is essential
to recovery. <i>Fresh air, and plenty of it, in scarlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1230'>1230</span>fever, is the best doctor</i> a child can have: let these
words be written legibly on your mind.<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Take down the curtains of the bed; remove the
valances. If it be summer time, let the child be only
covered with a sheet: if it be winter time, in addition
to the sheet, he should have one blanket over him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1231'>1231</span>Now for the throat.—The best <i>external</i> application
is a barm and oatmeal poultice. How ought it to be
made, and how applied? Put half a teacupful of barm
into a saucepan, put it on the fire to boil; as soon as
it boils take it off the fire, and stir oatmeal into it, until
it is of the consistence of a nice soft poultice; then
place it on a rag, and apply it to the throat; carefully
fasten it on with bandage, two or three turns of the
bandage going round the throat, and two or three over
the crown of the head, so as nicely to apply the poultice
where it is wanted—that is to say, to cover the
tonsils. Tack the bandage: do not pin it. Let the
poultice be changed three times a day. The best medicine
is the acidulated infusion of roses, sweetened
with syrup.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a> It is grateful and refreshing, it is pleasant
to take, it abates fever and thirst, it cleans the throat
and tongue of mucus, and is peculiarly efficacious in
scarlet fever; as soon as the fever is abated it gives an
appetite. My belief is that the sulphuric acid in the
mixture is a specific in scarlet fever, as much as quinine
is in ague, and sulphur in itch. I have reason to say
so, for, in numerous cases, I have seen its immense
value.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, with regard to food.—If the child be at the
breast, keep him entirely to it. If he be weaned, and
under two years old, give him milk and water, and cold
water to drink. If he be older, give him toast and
water, and plain water from the pump, as much as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1232'>1232</span>chooses; let it be quite cold—the colder the better.
Weak black tea, or thin gruel, may be given, but not
caring, unless he be an infant at the breast, if he take
nothing but <i>cold</i> water. If the child be two years old
and upwards, roasted apples with sugar, and grapes will
be very refreshing, and will tend to cleanse both the
mouth and the throat. Avoid broths and stimulants
of every kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the appetite returns, you may consider the
patient to be safe. The diet ought now to be gradually
improved. Bread and butter, milk and water, and
arrow-root made with equal parts of new milk and
water, should for the first two or three days be given.
Then a light batter or rice pudding may be added, and
in a few days afterward, either a little chicken or a
mutton-chop.</p>

<p class='c008'>The essential remedies, then, in scarlet fever, are,
for the first few days—(1) plenty of fresh air and ventilation,
(2) plenty of cold water to drink, (3) barm
poultices to the throat, and (4) the acidulated infusion
of roses’ mixture as a medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, then, comes very important advice. After the
first few days, probably five or six, sometimes as early
as the fourth day, <i>watch carefully and warily, and note
the time, the skin will suddenly become cool</i>, the child
will say that he feels chilly; then is the time you must
now change your tactics—<i>instantly close the windows,
and put extra clothing</i>, a blanket or two, on his bed.
A flannel night-gown should, until the dead skin has
peeled off, be now worn next to the skin, when the
flannel night-gown should be discontinued. The patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1233'>1233</span>ought ever after to wear, in the daytime, a flannel
waistcoat.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a> His drinks must now be given with the
chill off; he ought to have a warm cup of tea, and
gradually his diet should, as I have previously recommended
be improved.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one important caution I wish to impress
upon you,—<i>do not give opening medicine during the
time the eruption is out</i>. In all probability the bowels
will be opened: if so, all well and good; but do not,
on any account, for the first ten days, use artificial
means to open them. It is my firm conviction that the
administration of purgatives in scarlet fever is a fruitful
source of dropsy, of disease, and death. When we
take into consideration the sympathy there is between
the skin and the mucous membrane, I think that we
should pause before giving irritating medicines, such
as purgatives. The irritation of aperients on the mucous
membrane may cause the poison of the skin disease
(for scarlet fever is a blood poison) to be driven
internally to the kidneys, to the throat, to the pericardium
(bag of the heart), or to the brain. You may
say, Do you not purge if the bowels be not open for a
week? I say emphatically, No!</p>

<p class='c008'>I consider my great success in the treatment of scarlet
fever to be partly owing to my avoidance of aperients
during the first ten days of the child’s illness.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the bowels, after the ten days, are not properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1234'>1234</span>opened, a dose or two of the following mixture should
be given:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Simple Syrup, three drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Essence of Senna, nine drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. Two teaspoonfuls to be given early in the
morning occasionally, and to be repeated in four hours, if the first
dose should not operate.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a subsequent Conversation, I shall strongly urge
you not to allow your child, when convalescent, to leave
the house under at least a month from the commencement
of the illness; I therefore beg to refer you to
that Conversation, and hope that you will give it your
best and earnest consideration! During the last seventeen
years I have never had dropsy from scarlet fever,
and I attribute it entirely to the plan I have just recommended,
and in not allowing my patients to leave the
house under the month—until, in fact, the skin that
has peeled off has been renewed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us now sum up the plan I adopt:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Thorough ventilation, a cool room, and scant
clothes on the bed, for the first five or six days.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. A change of temperature of the skin to be carefully
regarded. As soon as the skin is cool, closing
the windows, and putting additional clothing on the
bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The acidulated infusion of roses with syrup is <i>the</i>
medicine for scarlet fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Purgatives to be religiously avoided for the first
ten days at least, and even afterward, unless there be
absolute necessity.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Leeches, blisters, emetics, cold and tepid spongings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1235'>1235</span>and painting the tonsils with caustic, inadmissible
in scarlet fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. A strict antiphlogistic (low) diet for the first few
days, during which time cold water to be given <i>ad
libitum</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. The patient <i>not</i> to leave the house in the summer
under the month; in the winter, under six weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not, then, apply either leeches
or blisters to the throat; do not paint the tonsils with
caustic; do not give aperients; do not, on any account,
give either calomel or emetic tartar; do not, for the first
few days of the illness, be afraid of <i>cold air</i> to the skin,
and of cold water as a beverage; do not, emphatically
let me say, <i>do not</i> let the child leave the house for at
least a month from the commencement of the illness.</p>

<p class='c008'>My firm conviction is, that purgatives, emetics, and
blisters, by depressing the patient, sometimes cause
ordinary scarlet fever to degenerate into malignant
scarlet fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am aware that some of our first authorities advocate
a different plan to mine. They recommend purgatives,
which I may say, in scarlet fever, are my dread
and abhorrence. They advise cold and tepid spongings—a
plan which I think dangerous, as it will probably
drive the disease internally. Blisters, too, have been
prescribed; these I consider weakening, injurious, and
barbarous, and likely still more to inflame the already
inflamed skin. They recommend leeches to the throat,
which I am convinced, by depressing the patient, will
lessen the chance of his battling against the disease,
and will increase the ulceration of the tonsils. Again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1236'>1236</span>the patient has not too much blood; the blood is only
poisoned. I look upon scarlet fever as a specific poison
of the blood, and one which will be eliminated from the
system, <i>not</i> by bleeding, <i>not</i> by purgatives, <i>not</i> by
emetics, but by a constant supply of fresh and cool air,
by the acid treatment, by cold water as a beverage, and
for the first few days by a strict antiphlogistic (low)
diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sydenham says that scarlet fever is oftentimes “fatal
through the officiousness of the doctor.” I conscientiously
believe that a truer remark was never made;
and that under a different system to the usual one
adopted, scarlet fever would not be so much dreaded.<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>221. <i>How soon ought a child to be allowed to leave the
house after an attack of Scarlet Fever?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He must <i>not</i> be allowed to go out for at least a month
from the commencement of the attack, in the summer,
and six weeks in the winter; and not even then with
out the express permission of a medical man. It might
be said that this is an unreasonable recommendation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1237'>1237</span>but when it is considered that the whole of the skin
generally desquamates, or peels off, and consequently
leaves the surface of the body exposed to cold, which
cold flies to the kidneys, producing a peculiar and serious
disease in them, ending in dropsy, this warning
will not be deemed unreasonable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarlet fever dropsy, which is really a <i>formidable
disease, generally arises from the carelessness, the ignorance,
and the thoughtlessness of parents in allowing
a child to leave the house before the new skin is
properly formed and hardened</i>. Prevention is always
better than cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus far with regard to the danger to the child himself.
Now, if you please, let me show you the risk of
contagion that you inflict upon families, in allowing
your child to mix with others before a month at least
has elapsed. Bear in mind, a case is quite as contagious,
if not more so, while the skin is peeling off, as
it was before. Thus, in ten days or a fortnight, there
is as much risk of contagion as at the <i>beginning</i> of the
disease, and when the fever is at its height. At the
conclusion of the month the old skin has generally all
peeled off, and the new skin has taken its place; consequently
there will then be less fear of contagion to
others. But the contagion of scarlet fever is so subtle
and so uncertain in its duration, that it is impossible
to fix the exact time when it ceases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me most earnestly implore you to ponder well
on the above important facts. If these remarks should
be the means of saving only one child from death, or
from broken health, my labor will not have been in
vain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1238'>1238</span>222. <i>What means do you advise to purify a house
from the contagion of Scarlet Fever?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let every room be <i>lime-washed</i> and then be white
washed;<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a> if the contagion has been virulent, let every
bedroom be freshly papered (the walls having been
previously stripped of the old paper and then lime-washed);
let the bed, the bolsters, the pillows, and the
mattresses be cleansed and purified; let the blankets
and coverlids be thoroughly washed, and then let them
be exposed to the open air—if taken into a field so much
the better; let the rooms be well scoured; let the windows,
top and bottom, be thrown wide open; let the
drains be carefully examined; let the pump-water be
scrutinized, to see that it be not contaminated by fecal
matter, either from the water-closet or from the privy;
let privies be emptied of their contents—<i>remember this
is most important advice</i>—then put into the empty
places lime and powdered charcoal, for it is a well-ascertained
fact that it is frequently impossible to rid a
house of the infection of scarlet fever without adopting
such a course. “In St. George’s, Southwark, the medical
officer reports that scarlatina ‘has raged fatally,
almost exclusively where privy or drain smells are to
be perceived in the houses.’”<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> Let the children who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1239'>1239</span>have not had, or who do not appear to be sickening for
scarlet fever, be sent away from home—if to a farm-house
so much the better. Indeed, leave no stone unturned,
no means untried, to exterminate the disease
from the house and from the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>223. <i>Will you describe the symptoms of Chicken-pox?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is occasionally, but not always, ushered in with
a slight shivering fit; the eruption shows itself in
about twenty-four hours from the child first appearing
poorly. It is a vesicular<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a> disease. The eruption
comes out in the form of small pimples, and principally
attacks the scalp, the neck, the back, the chest, and the
shoulders, but rarely the face; while in small-pox the
face is generally the part most affected. The next day
these pimples fill with water, and thus become vesicles;
on the third day they are at maturity. The vesicles
are quite separate and distinct from each other. There
is a slight redness around each of them. Fresh ones,
while the others are dying away, make their appearance.
Chicken-pox is usually attended with a slight
itching of the skin; when the vesicles are scratched
the fluid escapes, and leaves hard pearl-like substances,
which, in a few days, disappear. Chicken-pox never
leaves pit-marks behind. It is a child’s complaint;
adults scarcely, if ever, have it.</p>

<p class='c008'>224. <i>Is there any danger in Chicken-pox; and what
treatment do you advise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1240'>1240</span>It is not at all a dangerous, but, on the contrary, a
trivial complaint. It lasts only a few days, and requires
but little medicine. The patient ought, for three
or four days, to keep the house, and should abstain
from animal food. On the sixth day, but not until
then, a dose or two of a mild aperient is all that will
be required.</p>

<p class='c008'>225. <i>Is Chicken-pox infectious?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is a diversity of opinion on this head, but one
thing is certain—it cannot be communicated by inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>226. <i>What are the symptoms of Modified Small-pox?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The modified small-pox—that is to say, small-pox
that has been robbed of its virulence by the patient
having been either already vaccinated, or by his having
had a previous attack of small-pox—is ushered in with
severe symptoms, with symptoms almost as severe as
though the patient had not been already somewhat
protected either by vaccination or by the previous attack
of small-pox—that is to say, he has a shivering
fit, great depression of spirits and debility, <i>malaise</i>,
sickness, headache, and occasionally delirium. After
the above symptoms have lasted about three days, the
eruption shows itself. The immense value of the previous
vaccination, or the previous attack of small-pox,
now comes into play. In a case of <i>unprotected</i> small-pox,
the appearance of the eruption <i>aggravates</i> all the
above symptoms, and the danger begins; while in the
<i>modified</i> small-pox, the moment the eruption shows
itself, the patient feels better, and, as a rule, rapidly
recovers. The eruption of <i>modified</i> small-pox varies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1241'>1241</span>materially from the eruption of the <i>unprotected</i> small-pox.
The former eruption assumes a varied character,
and is composed, first of vesicles (containing water),
and secondly of pustules (containing matter), each of
which pustules has a depression in the center, and
thirdly of several red pimples without either water or
matter in them, and which sometimes assume a livid
appearance. These “breakings-out” generally show
themselves more upon the wrist, and sometimes up one
or both of the nostrils. While in the latter disease—the
<i>unprotected</i> small-pox—the “breaking-out” is composed
entirely of pustules containing matter, and which
pustules are more on the face than on any other part of
the body. There is generally a peculiar smell in both
diseases—an odor once smelt never to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, there is one most important remark I have to
make,—<i>the modified small-pox is contagious</i>. This
ought to be borne in mind, as a person laboring under
the disease must, if there be children in the house,
either be sent away himself, or else the children ought
to be banished both the house and the neighborhood.
Another important piece of advice is, let <i>all</i> in the
house—children and adults, one and all—be vaccinated,
even if any or all have been previously vaccinated.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i>—Let the patient keep his room, and if
he be very ill, his bed. Let the chamber be well ventilated.
If it be winter time, a small fire in the grate
will encourage ventilation. If it be summer, a fire is
out of the question; indeed, in such a case, the window-sash
ought to be opened, as thorough ventilation is an
important requisite of cure, both in small-pox and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1242'>1242</span><i>modified</i> small-pox. While the eruption is out, do not
on any account give aperient medicine. In ten days
from the commencement of the illness a mild aperient
may be given. The best medicine in these cases is, the
sweetened acidulated infusion of roses,<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a> which ought
to be given from the commencement of the disease, and
should be continued until the fever be abated. For the
first few days, as long as the fever lasts, the patient
ought not to be allowed either meat or broth, but
should be kept on a low diet, such as on gruel, arrow-root,
milk puddings, etc. As soon as the fever is abated
he ought gradually to resume his usual diet. When he
is convalescent, it is well, where practicable, that he
should have change of air for a month.</p>

<p class='c008'>227. <i>How would you distinguish between Modified
Small-pox and Chicken-pox?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Modified small-pox may readily be distinguished
from chicken-pox, by the former disease being, notwithstanding
its modification, much more severe and
the fever much more intense <i>before</i> the eruption shows
itself than chicken-pox; indeed, in chicken-pox there is
little or no fever either before or after the eruption;
by the former disease, the modified small-pox, consisting
<i>partly</i> of pustules (containing matter), each pustule
having a depression in the center, and the favorite
localities of the pustules being the wrists and the inside
of the nostrils: while, in the chicken-pox, the
eruption consists of vesicles (containing water), and
<i>not</i> pustules (containing matter), and the vesicles having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1243'>1243</span>neither a depression in the center, nor having any
particular partiality to attack either the wrists or the
wings of the nose. In modified small-pox each pustule
is, as in unprotected small-pox, inflamed at the base;
while in chicken-pox there is only very slight redness
around each vesicle. The vesicles, too, in chicken-pox
are small—much smaller than the pustules are in
modified small-pox.</p>

<p class='c008'>228. <i>Is Hooping-cough an inflammatory disease?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Hooping-cough in itself is not inflammatory, it is
purely spasmodic; but it is generally accompanied with
more or less of bronchitis—inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the bronchial tubes—on which account
it is necessary, <i>in all cases</i> of hooping-cough, to consult
a medical man, that he may watch the progress of
the disease and nip inflammation in the bud.</p>

<p class='c008'>229. <i>Will you have the goodness to give the symptoms,
and a brief history, of Hooping-cough?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Hooping-cough is emphatically a disease of the
young; it is rare for adults to have it; if they do, they
usually suffer more severely than children. A child
seldom has it but once in his life. It is highly contagious,
and therefore frequently runs through a whole
family of children, giving much annoyance, anxiety,
and trouble to the mother and the nurses; hence hooping-cough
is much dreaded by them. It is amenable
to treatment. Spring and summer are the best seasons
of the year for the disease to occur. This complaint
usually lasts from six to twelve weeks—sometimes for
a much longer period, more especially if proper means
are not employed to relieve it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1244'>1244</span>Hooping-cough commences as a common cold and
cough. The cough, for ten days or a fortnight, increases
in intensity; at about which time it puts on
the characteristic “hoop.” The attack of cough comes
on in paroxysms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a paroxysm the child coughs so long and so violently,
and <i>expires</i> so much air from the lungs without
<i>inspiring</i> any, that at times he appears nearly suffocated
and exhausted; the veins of his neck swell; his
face is nearly purple; his eyes, with the tremendous
exertion, seem almost to start from their sockets; at
length there is a sudden <i>inspiration</i> of air through the
contracted chink of the upper part of the windpipe—the
glottis—causing the peculiar “hoop; and, after a
little more coughing, he brings up some glairy mucus
from the chest; and sometimes, by vomiting, food from
the stomach; he is at once relieved until the next
paroxysm occurs, when the same process is repeated,
the child during the intervals, in a favorable case,
appearing quite well, and after the cough is over, instantly
returning either to his play or to his food.
Generally, after a paroxysm he is hungry, unless, indeed,
there be severe inflammation either of the chest
or of the lungs. Sickness, as I before remarked, frequently
accompanies hooping-cough; when it does, it
might be looked upon as a good sign. The child
usually knows when an attack is coming on; he dreads
it, and therefore tries to prevent it; he sometimes partially
succeeds; but if he does, it only makes the
attack, when it does come, more severe. All causes
of irritation and excitement ought, as much as possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1245'>1245</span>to be avoided, as passion is apt to bring on a severe
paroxysm.</p>

<p class='c008'>A new-born babe, an infant of one or two months
old, commonly escapes the infection; but if at that
tender age he unfortunately catch hooping-cough, it
is likely to fare harder with him than if he were older—the
younger the child the greater the risk. But still,
in such a case, do not despair, as I have known numerous
instances of new-born infants, with judicious care,
recover perfectly from the attack, and thrive after it as
though nothing of the kind had ever happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>A new-born babe laboring under hooping-cough is
liable to convulsions, which is, in this disease, one, indeed
the great, source of danger. A child, too, who
is teething, and laboring under the disease, is also
liable to convulsions. When the patient is convalescing,
care ought to be taken that he does not catch
cold, or the “hoop” might return. Hooping-cough
may either precede, attend, or follow an attack of
measles.</p>

<p class='c008'>230. <i>What is the treatment of Hooping-cough?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>We will divide the hooping-cough into three stages,
and treat each stage separately.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What to do.</i>—<i>In the first stage</i>, the commencement
of hooping-cough: For the first ten days give the ipecacuanha
wine mixture,<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a> a teaspoonful three times
a day. If the child be not weaned, keep him entirely
to the breast; if he be weaned, to a milk and farinaceous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1246'>1246</span>diet. Confine him for the first ten days to the
house, more especially if the hooping-cough be attended,
as it usually is, with more or less of bronchitis. But
take care that the rooms be well ventilated, for good
air is essential to the cure. If the bronchitis attending
the hooping-cough be severe, confine him to his bed,
and treat him as though it were simply a case of bronchitis.<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><i>In the second stage</i>, discontinue the ipecacuanha
mixture, and give Dr. Gibb’s remedy—namely, nitric
acid—which I have found to be an efficacious and
valuable one in hooping-cough:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Diluted Nitric Acid, two drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Compound Tincture of Cardamoms, half a drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, three ounces;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, two ounces and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Make a Mixture. One or two teaspoonfuls, or a tablespoonful,
according to the age of the child—one teaspoonful for an infant of
six months, and two teaspoonfuls for a child of twelve months, and
one tablespoonful for a child of two years, every four hours, first
shaking the bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let the spine and the chest be well rubbed every
night and morning either with Roche’s Embrocation,
or with the following stimulating liniment (first shaking
the bottle):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Oil of Cloves, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Oil of Amber, two drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Camphorated Oil, nine drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Make a Liniment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let him wear a broad band of new flannel, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1247'>1247</span>should extend round from his chest to his back, and
which ought to be changed every night and morning,
in order that it may be dried before putting on again.
To keep it in its place it should be fastened by means of
tapes and with shoulder-straps.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet ought now to be improved—he should
gradually return to his usual food; and, weather permitting,
should almost live in the open air—fresh air
being, in such a case, one of the finest medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>In the third stage</i>, that is to say, when the complaint
has lasted a month, if by that time the child is not
well, there is nothing like change of air to a high, dry,
healthy, country place. Continue the nitric acid
mixture, and either the embrocation or the liniment
to the back and the chest, and let him continue to
almost live in the open air, and be sure that he does
not discontinue wearing the flannel until he be quite
cured, and then let it be left off by degrees.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the hooping-cough have caused debility, give him
cod-liver oil, a teaspoonful twice or three times a day,
giving it him on a full stomach after his meals.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, remember, after the first three or four weeks,
change of air, and plenty of it, is for hooping-cough
the grand remedy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not apply leeches to the chest,
for I would rather put blood into a child laboring under
hooping-cough than take it out of him—hooping-cough
is quite weakening enough to the system of
itself without robbing him of his life’s blood; do not,
on any account whatever, administer either emetic
tartar or antimonial wine; do not give either paregoric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1248'>1248</span>or syrup of white poppies; do not drug him either with
calomel or with gray powder; do not dose him with
quack medicine; do not give him stimulants, but
rather give him plenty of nourishment, such as milk
and farinaceous food, but <i>no</i> stimulants; do not be
afraid, after the first week or two, of his having fresh
air, and plenty of it—for fresh, pure air is the grand
remedy, after all that can be said and done, in hooping-cough.
Although occasionally we find that if the child
be laboring under hooping-cough and is breathing a
pure country air, and is not getting well so rapidly as
we could wish, change of air to a smoky, gas-laden
town will sometimes quickly effect a cure; indeed,
some persons go so far as to say that the <i>best</i> remedy
for an <i>obstinate</i> case of hooping-cough is for the child
to live the great part of every day in gas-works!</p>

<p class='c008'>231. <i>What is to be done during a paroxysm of
Hooping-cough?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If the child be old enough, let him stand up; but if
he be either too young or too feeble, raise his head,
and bend his body a little forward; then support his
back with one hand, and the forehead with the other.
Let the mucus, the moment it is within reach, be wiped
with a soft handkerchief out of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>232. <i>In an obstinate case of Hooping-cough, what is
the best remedy?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Change of air, provided there be no active inflammation,
to any healthy spot. A farm-house, in a high,
dry, and salubrious neighborhood, is as good a place
as can be chosen. If, in a short time, he be not quite
well, take him to the sea-side: the sea breezes will
often, as if by magic, drive away the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1249'>1249</span>233. <i>Suppose my child should have a shivering fit,
is it to be looked upon as an important symptom?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly. Nearly all <i>serious</i> illnesses commence
with a shivering fit: severe colds, influenza, inflammations
of different organs, scarlet fever, measles,
small-pox, and very many other diseases, begin in this
way. If, therefore, your child should ever have a
shivering fit, <i>instantly</i> send for a medical man, as delay
might be dangerous. A few hours of judicious
treatment, at the commencement of an illness, is frequently
of more avail than days and weeks, nay
months, of treatment, when disease has gained a firm
footing. A <i>serious</i> disease often steals on insidiously,
and we have, perhaps, only the shivering fit, which
might be but a <i>slight</i> one, to tell us of its approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>trifling</i> ailment, too, by neglecting the premonitory
symptom, which, at first, might only be indicated
by a <i>slight</i> shivering fit, will sometimes become a
<i>mortal</i> disorder:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1250'>1250</span>234. <i>In case of a shivering fit, perhaps you will
tell me what to do?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>Instantly</i> have the bed warmed, and put the child
to bed. Apply either a hot bottle or a hot brick,
wrapped in flannel, to the soles of his feet. Put an
extra blanket on his bed, and give him a hot cup of
tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the shivering fit is over, and he has become
hot, gradually lessen the <i>extra</i> quantity of
clothes on his bed, and take away the hot bottle or the
hot brick from his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>What</i> <span class='fss'>NOT</span> <i>to do</i>.—Do not give either brandy or wine,
as inflammation of some organ might be about taking
place. Do not administer opening medicine, as there
might be some “breaking-out” coming out on the
skin, and an aperient might check it.</p>

<p class='c008'>235. <i>My child, apparently otherwise healthy, screams
out in the night violently in his sleep, and nothing for
a time will pacify him: what is likely to be the cause,
and what is the treatment?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The causes of these violent screamings in the night
are various. At one time, they proceed from teething;
at another, from worms; sometimes, from night-mare;
occasionally, from either disordered stomach or bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each of the above causes will, of course, require a
different plan of procedure; it will, therefore, be necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1251'>1251</span>to consult a medical man on the subject, who will
soon, with appropriate treatment, be able to relieve
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>236. <i>Have the goodness to describe the complaint of
children called Mumps.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The mumps, inflammation of the “parotid” gland,
is commonly ushered in with a slight feverish attack.
After a short time, a swelling, of stony hardness, is
noticed before and under the ear, which swelling extends
along the neck toward the chin. This lump is
exceedingly painful, and continues painful and swollen
for four or five days. At the end of which time it
gradually disappears, leaving not a trace behind.
The swelling of mumps never gathers. It may affect
one or both sides of the face. It seldom occurs but
once in a lifetime. It is contagious, and has been
known to run through a whole family or school; but
it is not dangerous, unless, which is rarely the case, it
leaves the “parotid” gland, and migrates either to the
head, to the breast, or to the testicle.</p>

<p class='c008'>237. <i>What is the treatment of Mumps?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Foment the swelling, four or five times a day, with
a flannel wrung out of hot chamomile and poppy-head
decoction;<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a> and apply, every night, a barm and oatmeal
poultice to the swollen gland or glands. Debar, for a
few days, the little patient from taking meat and broth,
and let him live on bread and milk, light puddings, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1252'>1252</span>arrow-root. Keep him in a well-ventilated room, and
shut him out from the company of his brothers, his
sisters, and young companions. Give him a little mild,
aperient medicine. Of course, if there be the slightest
symptom of migration to any other part or parts, instantly
call in a medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>238. <i>What is the treatment of a Boil?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>One of the best applications is a Burgundy pitch
plaster spread on a soft piece of wash-leather. Let a
chemist spread a plaster, about the size of the hand;
and, from this piece, cut small plasters, the size of a
shilling or a florin (according to the dimensions of the
boil), which snip around and apply to the part. Put
a fresh one on daily. This plaster will soon cause the
boil to break; when it does break, squeeze out the contents,
the core, and the matter, and then apply one of
the plasters as before, which, until the boil be well,
renew every day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old-fashioned remedy for a boil—namely, common
yellow soap and brown sugar, is a capital one for
the purposes; it should be made into a paste, and spread
on a piece of coarse linen, the size either of a shilling
or of a florin (according to the size of the boil); it eases
the pain and causes the boil soon to break, and draws
it when it is broken; it should be renewed daily.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>If the boils should arise from the child being in a
delicate state of health</i>, give him cod-liver oil, meat
once a day, and an abundance of milk and farinaceous
food. Let him have plenty of fresh air, exercise, and
play.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>If the boils should arise from gross and improper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1253'>1253</span>feeding</i>, then keep him for a time from meat, and let
him live principally on a milk and farinaceous diet.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>If the child be fat and gross</i>, cod-liver oil would be
improper; a mild aperient, such as rhubarb and magnesia,
would then be the best medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>239. <i>What are the symptoms of Earache?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A young child screaming shrilly, violently, and continuously,
is oftentimes owing to earache; carefully,
therefore, examine each ear, and ascertain if there be
any discharge; if there be, the mystery is explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Screaming from earache may be distinguished from
the screaming from bowelache by the former (earache)
being more continuous—indeed, being one continued
scream, and from the child putting his hand to his
head; while, in the latter (bowelache), the pain is more
of a coming and of a going character, and he draws
up his legs to his bowels. Again, in the former (earache),
the secretions from the bowels are natural;
while, in the latter (bowelache), the secretions from
the bowels are usually depraved, and probably offensive.
But a careful examination of the ear will generally at
once decide the nature of the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>240. <i>What is the best remedy for Earache?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Apply to the ear a small flannel bag, filled with hot
salt—as hot as can be comfortably borne, or foment the
ear with a flannel wrung out of hot chamomile and
poppy-head decoction. A roasted onion, inclosed in
muslin, applied to the ear, is an old-fashioned and
favorite remedy, and may, if the bag of hot salt, or if
the hot fomentation do not relieve, be tried. Put into
the ear, but not very far, a small piece of cotton wool,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1254'>1254</span>moistened with warm olive oil. Taking care that the
wool is always removed before a fresh piece be substituted,
as if it be allowed to remain in any length of
time, it may produce a discharge from the ear. Avoid
all <i>cold</i> applications. If the earache be severe, keep
the little fellow at home, in a room of equal temperature,
but well ventilated, and give him, for a day or two,
no meat.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a discharge from the ear should either accompany
or follow the earache, <i>more especially if the discharge
be offensive</i>, instantly call in a medical man, or deafness
for life may be the result.</p>

<p class='c008'>A knitted or crocheted hat, with woolen rosettes
over the ears, is, in the winter time, an excellent hat
for a child subject to earache. The hat may be procured
at any baby-linen warehouse.</p>

<p class='c008'>241. <i>What are the causes and the treatment of discharges
from the Ear?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Cold, measles, scarlet fever, healing up of “breakings-out”
behind the ear; pellets of cotton wool, which
had been put in the ear, and had been forgotten to be
removed, are the usual causes of discharges from the
ear. It generally commences with earache.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>treatment</i> consists in keeping the parts clean,
by syringing the ear every morning with warm water,
by attention to food, keeping the child principally upon
a milk and a farinaceous diet, and by change of air,
more especially to the coast. If change of air be not
practicable, great attention ought to be paid to ventilation.
As I have before advised, in all cases of discharge
from the ear, call in a medical man, as a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1255'>1255</span>judicious medicine is advisable—indeed, essential; and
it may be necessary to syringe the ear with lotions,
instead of with warm water; and, of course, it is only
a doctor who has actually seen the patient who can
decide these matters, and what is best to be done in
each individual case.</p>

<p class='c008'>242. <i>What is the treatment of a “sty” in the eyelid?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Bathe the eye frequently with warm milk and water,
and apply, every night at bedtime, a warm white-bread
poultice.</p>

<p class='c008'>No medicine is required; but if the child be gross,
keep him for a few days from meat, and let him live on
bread and milk and farinaceous puddings.</p>

<p class='c008'>243. <i>If a child have large bowels, what would you
recommend as likely to reduce their size?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It ought to be borne in mind that the bowels of a
child are larger in proportion than those of an adult.
But, if they be actually larger than they ought to be,
let them be well rubbed for a quarter of an hour at
a time night and morning, with soap liniment, and
then apply a broad flannel belt. “A broad flannel belt
worn night and day, firm but not tight, is very serviceable.”<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a>
The child ought to be prevented from drinking
as much as he has been in the habit of doing; let
him be encouraged to exercise himself well in the open
air; and let strict regard be paid to his diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>244. <i>What are the best aperients for a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If it be <i>actually</i> necessary to give him opening medicine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1256'>1256</span>one or two teaspoonfuls of syrup of senna, repeated
if necessary, in four hours, will generally answer
the purpose; or, for a change, one or two teaspoonfuls
of castor oil may be substituted. Lenitive electuary
(compound confection of senna) is another excellent
aperient for the young, it being mild in its operation,
and pleasant to take; a child fancying it is nothing
more than jam, and which it much resembles both in
appearance and in taste. The dose is half or one teaspoonful
early in the morning occasionally. Senna is an
admirable aperient for a child, and is a safe one, which
is more than can be said of many others. It is worthy
of note that “the taste of senna may be concealed by
sweetening the infusion,<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a> adding milk, and drinking as
ordinary tea, which, when thus prepared, it much resembles.”<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a>
Honey, too, is a nice aperient for a child—a
teaspoonful ought to be given either by itself, or
spread on a slice of bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some mothers are in the habit of giving their children
jalap gingerbread. I do not approve of it, as jalap is a
drastic griping purgative; besides, jalap is very nasty
to take—nothing will make it palatable.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1257'>1257</span>Fluid magnesia—solution of the bicarbonate of magnesia—is
a good aperient for a child; and, as it has
very little taste, is readily given, more especially if
made palatable by the addition either of a little syrup
or of brown sugar. The advantages which it has over
the old solid form are, that it is colorless and nearly
tasteless, and never forms concretions in the bowels, as
the <i>solid</i> magnesia, if persevered in for any length of
time, sometimes does. A child two or three years
old may take one or two tablespoonfuls of the fluid,
either by itself or in his food, repeating it every four
hours until the bowels be opened. When the child is
old enough to drink the draught off <i>immediately</i>, the
addition of one or two teaspoonfuls of lemon-juice,
to each dose of the fluid magnesia, makes a pleasant
effervescing draught, and increases its efficacy as an
aperient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bran-bread<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a> and <i>treacle</i> will frequently open the
bowels; and as treacle is wholesome, it may be substituted
for butter when the bowels are inclined to be costive.
A roasted apple, eaten with <i>raw</i> sugar, is another
excellent mild aperient for a child. Milk gruel—that
is to say, milk thickened with oatmeal—forms an excellent
food for him, and often keeps his bowels regular,
and thus (<i>which is a very important consideration</i>)
supersedes the necessity of giving him an aperient.
An orange (taking care he does not eat the peel or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1258'>1258</span>pulp), or a fig after dinner, or a few Muscatel raisins,
will frequently regulate the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stewed prunes is another admirable remedy for the
costiveness of a child. The manner of stewing them is
as follows: Put a pound of prunes in a brown jar, add
two tablespoonfuls of <i>raw</i> sugar, then cover the prunes
and the sugar with cold water; place them in the oven,
and let them stew for four hours. A child should
every morning eat half a dozen or a dozen of them,
until the bowels be relieved, taking care that he does
not swallow the stones.</p>

<p class='c008'>A suppository is a mild and ready way of opening
the bowels of a child. When he is two or three years
old and upwards, a <i>candle</i> suppository is better than a
<i>soap</i> suppository. The way of preparing it is as follows:
Cut a piece of dip-tallow candle—the length of
three inches—and insert it as you would a clyster pipe,
about two inches up the fundament, allowing the remaining
inch to be in sight, and there let the suppository
remain until the bowels be opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>245. <i>What are the most frequent causes of Protrusion
of the lower bowel?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The too common and reprehensible practice of a
parent administering frequent aperients, especially
calomel and jalap, to her child. Another cause, is
allowing him to remain for a quarter of an hour or
more at a time on his chair; this induces him to
strain, and to force the gut down.</p>

<p class='c008'>246. <i>What are the remedies?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If the protrusion of the bowel have been brought on
by the abuse of aperients, abstain for the future from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1259'>1259</span>giving them; but if medicine be absolutely required,
give the mildest—such as either syrup of senna or
castor oil—<i>and the less of those the better</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the <i>external</i> application of a purgative will have
the desired effect, it will, in such cases, be better than
the <i>internal</i> administration of aperients. Dr. Merriman’s
Purgative Liniment<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c014'><sup>[248]</sup></a> is a good one for the purpose.
Let the bowels be well rubbed every night and
morning, for five minutes at a time, with the liniment.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wet compress to the bowels will frequently open
them, and will thus do away with the necessity of
giving an aperient—<i>a most important consideration</i>.
Fold a napkin in six thicknesses, soak it in <i>cold</i> water,
and apply it to the bowels, over which put either a
thin covering or sheet of gutta-percha, or a piece of
oiled silk; keep it in its place with a broad flannel
roller, and let it remain on the bowels for three or four
hours, or until they be opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Try what diet will do, as opening the bowels by a
regulated diet is far preferable to the giving of aperients.
Let him have either bran-bread, Robinson’s Patent
Groats made into gruel with new milk, or Du Barry’s
Arabica Revalenta, or a slice of Huntley and Palmer’s
lump gingerbread. Let him eat stewed prunes, stewed
rhubarb, roasted apples, strawberries, raspberries, the
inside of grapes and gooseberries, figs, etc. Give him
early every morning a draught of <i>cold</i> water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me, again, urge you <i>not</i> to give aperients in
these cases, or in any case, unless you are absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1260'>1260</span>compelled. By following my advice you will save
yourself an immense deal of trouble, and your child a
long catalogue of misery. Again, I say, look well
into the matter, and whenever it be practicable, avoid
purgatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, with regard to the best manner of returning
the bowel, lay the child upon the bed on his face and
bowels, with his hips a little raised; then smear lard
on the forefinger of your right hand (taking care that
the nail be cut close) and gently with your forefinger
press the bowel into its proper place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember, if the above methods be observed, you
cannot do the slightest injury to the bowel, and the
sooner it be returned the better it will be for the child;
for, if the bowel be allowed to remain long down, it
may slough or mortify, and death may ensue. The
nurse, every time he has a motion, must see that the
bowel does not come down, and if it does, she ought
instantly to return it. Moreover, the nurse should be
careful <i>not</i> to allow the child to remain on his chair
more than two or three minutes at a time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another excellent remedy for the protrusion of the
lower bowel is to use every morning a cold salt and
water sitz-bath. There need not be more than a depth
of three inches of water in the bath; a small handful
of table salt should be dissolved in the water; a dash
of warm water in the winter time must be added to
take off the extreme chill, and the child ought not to
be allowed to sit in the bath for more than one minute,
or while the mother can count a hundred, taking care
the while to throw either a square of flannel or a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1261'>1261</span>shawl over his shoulders. The sitz-bath ought to be
continued for months, or until the complaint be removed.
I cannot speak in too high praise of these baths.</p>

<p class='c008'>247. <i>Do you advise me, every spring and fall, to
give my child brimstone to purify and sweeten his
blood, and as a preventive medicine?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not: if you wish to take away his appetite
and to weaken and depress him, give him brimstone!
Brimstone is not a remedy fit for a child’s stomach.
The principal use and value of brimstone is as an external
application in itch, and as an internal remedy,
mixed with other laxatives, in piles—piles being a
complaint of adults. In olden times poor unfortunate
children were dosed every spring and fall with brimstone
and treacle, to sweeten their blood! Fortunately
for the present race, there is not so much of that folly
practiced, but still there is room for improvement.</p>

<p class='c008'>To dose a <i>healthy</i> child with physic is the grossest
absurdity. No, the less physic a delicate child has the
better it will be for him, but physic to a healthy child
is downright poison!—and brimstone of all medicines!
It is both weakening and depressing to the system,
and by opening the pores of the skin and by relaxing
the bowels, is likely to give cold, and thus to make a
healthy a sickly child. Sweeten his blood! It is more
likely to weaken his blood, and thus to make his blood
impure! Blood is not made pure by drugs, but by
Nature’s medicine: by exercise, by pure air, by wholesome
diet, by sleep in a well-ventilated apartment, by
regular and thorough ablution. Brimstone a preventive
medicine? Preventive medicine—and brimstone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1262'>1262</span>especially in the guise of a preventive medicine—is “a
mockery, a delusion, and a snare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>248. <i>When a child is delicate, and his body, without
any assignable cause is gradually wasting away, and
the stomach rejects all food that is taken, what plan
can be adopted likely to support his strength, and thus,
probably, be the means of saving his life?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I have seen, in such a case, great benefit to arise
from half a teacupful of either strong mutton broth, or
of strong beef-tea, used as an enema, every four hours.<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>It should be administered slowly, in order that it
may remain in the bowel. If the child be sinking,
either a dessertspoonful of brandy, or half a wineglassful
of port wine ought to be added to each enema.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above plan ought only to be adopted if there be
<i>no</i> diarrhœa. If there be diarrhœa, an enema must
<i>not</i> be used. Then, provided there be great wasting
away, and extreme exhaustion, and other remedies
having failed, it would be advisable to give, by the
mouth, <i>raw</i> beef of the finest quality, which ought to
be taken from the hip-bone, and should be shredded
very fine. All fat and skin must be carefully removed.
One or two teaspoonfuls (according to the age of the
child) ought to be given every four hours. The giving
of <i>raw</i> meat to children in exhaustive diseases, such as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1263'>1263</span>excessive long-standing diarrhœa, was introduced into
practice by a Russian physician, a Professor Weisse,
of St. Petersburg. It certainly is, in these cases, a
most valuable remedy, and has frequently been the
means of snatching such patients from the jaws of
death. Children usually take raw meat with avidity
and with a relish.</p>

<p class='c008'>249. <i>If a child be naturally delicate, what plan
would you recommend to strengthen him?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I should advise strict attention to the rules above
mentioned, and <i>change of air</i>—more especially, if it be
possible, to the coast. Change of air, sometimes, upon
a delicate child, acts like magic, and may restore him
to health when all other means have failed. If a girl
be delicate, “carry her off to the farm, there to undergo
the discipline of new milk, brown bread, early hours,
no lessons, and romps in the hay-field.”<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a> This advice
is, of course, equally applicable for a delicate boy, as
delicate boys and delicate girls ought to be treated
alike. Unfortunately, in these very enlightened days!
there is too great a distinction made in the respective
management and treatment of boys and girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best medicines for a delicate child will be the
wine of iron and cod-liver oil. Give them combined in
the manner I shall advise when speaking of the treatment
of Rickets.</p>

<p class='c008'>In diseases of long standing, and that resist the usual
remedies, there is nothing like <i>change of air</i>. Hippocrates,
the father of medicine, says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1264'>1264</span>“In longis morbis solum mutare.”</div>
      <div class='line'>(In tedious diseases to change the place of residence.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A child who, in the winter, is always catching cold,
whose life during half of the year is one continued
catarrh, who is in consequence likely, if he grow up at
all, to grow up a confirmed invalid, ought, during the
winter months, to seek another clime; and if the
parents can afford the expense, they should, at the
beginning of October, cause him to bend his steps to
the south of Europe—Mentone being as good a place as
they could probably fix upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>250. <i>Do you approve of sea bathing for a delicate
young child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No: he is frequently so frightened by it that the
alarm would do him more harm than the bathing would
do him good. The better plan would be to have him
every morning well sponged, especially his back and
loins, with sea water; and to have him as much as possible
carried on the beach, in order that he may inhale
the sea breezes.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he be older, and is not frightened at being
dipped, sea bathing will be very beneficial to him. If
bathing is to do good, either to an adult or to a child,
it must be anticipated with pleasure, and neither with
dread nor with distaste.</p>

<p class='c008'>251. <i>What is the best method of administering medicine
to a child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If he be old enough, appeal to his reason; for, if a
mother endeavor to deceive her child, and he detect
her, he will for the future suspect her.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he be too young to be reasoned with, then, if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1265'>1265</span>will not take his medicine, he must be compelled. Lay
him across your knees, let both his hands and his nose
be tightly held, and then, by means of the patent medicine-spoon,
or, if that be not at hand, by either a tea
or a dessertspoon, pour the medicine down his throat,
and he will be obliged to swallow it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be said that this is a cruel procedure; but
it is the only way to compel an unruly child to take
physic, and is much less cruel than running the risk
of his dying from the medicine not having been administered.<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>252. <i>Ought a sick child to be roused from his sleep
to give him physic, when it is time for him to take it?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>On no account, as sleep, being a natural restorative,
must not be interfered with. A mother cannot be too
particular in administering the medicine, at stated
periods, while he is awake.</p>

<p class='c008'>253. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the management
of a sick-room, and have you any directions to
give on the nursing of a sick child?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>In sickness select a large and lofty room; if in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1266'>1266</span>town, the back of the house will be preferable—in order
to keep the patient free from noise and bustle—as a
sick-chamber cannot be kept too quiet. Be sure that
there be a chimney in the room—as there ought to be
in <i>every</i> room in the house—and that it be not stopped,
as it will help to carry off the impure air of the apartment.
Keep the chamber <i>well ventilated</i>, by, from
time to time, opening the window. The air of the
apartment cannot be too pure; therefore, let the evacuations
from the bowels be instantly removed, either to
a distant part of the house, or to an out-house, or to the
cellar, as it might be necessary to keep them for the
medical man’s inspection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let there be a frequent change of linen, as in sickness
it is even more necessary than in health, more especially
if the complaint be fever. In an attack of fever
clean sheets ought, every other day, to be put on the
bed; clean body-linen every day. A frequent change
of linen in sickness is most refreshing.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the complaint be fever, a fire in the grate will not
be necessary. Should it be a case either of inflammation
of the lungs or of the chest, a small fire in the
winter time is desirable, keeping the temperature of the
room as nearly as possible at 60° Fahrenheit. Bear in
mind that a large fire in a sick-room cannot be too
strongly condemned; for if there be fever—and there
are scarcely any complaints without—a large fire only
increases it. Small fires, in cases either of inflammation
of the lungs or of the chest, in the winter time,
encourage ventilation of the apartment, and thus carry
off impure air. If it be summer time of course fires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1267'>1267</span>would be improper. A thermometer is an indispensable
requisite in a sick-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fever, free and thorough ventilation is of vital importance,
more especially in scarlet fever; then a patient
cannot have too much air; in scarlet fever, for the first
few days the windows, be it winter or summer, must
to the widest extent be opened. The fear of the patient
catching cold by doing so is one of the numerous prejudices
and baseless fears that haunt the nursery, and
the sooner it is exploded the better it will be for human
life. The valances and bed-curtains ought to be removed,
and there should be as little furniture in the
room as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it be a case of measles, it will be necessary to
adopt a different course; then the windows ought not
to be opened, but the door must from time to time be
left ajar. In a case of measles, if it be winter time, a
<i>small</i> fire in the room will be necessary. In inflammation
of the lungs or of the chest, the windows should
not be opened, but the door ought occasionally to be
left unfastened, in order to change the air and to make
it pure. Remember, then, that ventilation, either by
open window or by open door, is most necessary in all
diseases. Ventilation is one of the best friends a doctor
has.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fever, do not load the bed with clothes; in the
summer a sheet is sufficient, in the winter a sheet and
a blanket.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fever, do not be afraid of allowing the patient
plenty either of cold water or of cold toast and water;
Nature will tell him when he has had enough. In
measles, let the chill be taken off the toast and water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1268'>1268</span>In <i>croup</i>, have always ready a plentiful supply of hot
water, in case a warm bath might be required.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>child-crowing</i>, have always in the sick-room a
supply of cold water, ready at a moments notice to
dash upon the face.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fever, do not let the little patient lie on the lap;
he will rest more comfortably on a horse-hair mattress
in his crib or cot. If he have pain in the bowels, the
lap is most agreeable to him: the warmth of the body,
either of the mother or of the nurse, soothes him;
besides, if he be on the lap, he can be turned on his
stomach and on his bowels, which often affords him
great relief and comfort. If he be much emaciated,
when he is nursed, place a pillow upon the lap and let
him lie upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <i>head affections</i>, darken the room with a <i>green</i>
calico blind; keep the chamber more than usually quiet;
let what little talking is necessary be carried on in
whispers, but the less of that the better; and in <i>head
affections</i>, never allow smelling-salts to be applied to
the nose, as they only increase the flow of blood to the
head, and consequently do harm.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is often a good sign when a child, who is seriously
ill, suddenly becomes cross. It is then he begins to
feel his weakness, and to give vent to his feelings.
“Children are almost always cross when recovering
from an illness, however patient they may have been
during its severest moments, and the phenomenon is
not by any means confined to children.”<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1269'>1269</span>A sick child must <i>not</i> be stuffed with <i>much</i> food at a
time. He will take either a tablespoonful of new milk
or a tablespoonful of chicken-broth every half hour, with
greater advantage than a teacupful of either the one or
the other every four hours, which large quantity would
very probably be rejected from his stomach, and may
cause the unfortunately treated child to die of starvation!</p>

<p class='c008'>If a sick child be peevish, attract his attention either
by a toy or by an ornament; if he be cross, win him
over to good humor by love, affection, and caresses, but
let it be done gently and without noise. Do not let
visitors see him; they will only excite, distract, and
irritate him, and help to consume the oxygen of the atmosphere,
and thus rob the air of its exhilarating health-giving
qualities and purity; a sick-room, therefore, is
not a proper place either for visitors or for gossips.</p>

<p class='c008'>In selecting a sick-nurse, let her be gentle, patient,
cheerful, quiet, and kind, but firm withal; she ought to
be neither old nor young; if she be old, she is often
garrulous and prejudiced, and thinks too much of her
trouble; if she be young, she is frequently thoughtless
and noisy; therefore choose a middle-aged woman. Do
not let there be in the sick-room more than, besides the
mother, one efficient nurse; a great number can be of
no service—they will only be in each other’s way, and
will distract the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let stillness, especially if the head be the part affected,
reign in a sick-room. Creaking shoes<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> and rustling silk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1270'>1270</span>dresses ought not to be worn in sick-chambers—they
are quite out of place there. If the child be asleep, or
if he be dozing, perfect stillness must be enjoined—not
even a whisper should be heard:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If there be other children, let them be removed to a
distant part of the house; or, if the disease be of an
infectious nature, let them be sent away from home
altogether.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all illnesses—and bear in mind the following is
most important advice—a child must be encouraged to
try and make water, whether he ask or not, at least four
times during the twenty-four hours; and at any other
time, if be expresses the slightest inclination to do so. I
have known a little fellow to hold his water, to his great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1271'>1271</span>detriment, for twelve hours, because either the mother
had in her trouble forgotten to inquire, or the child himself
was either too ill or too indolent to make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>See that the medical man’s directions are, to the very
letter, carried out. Do not fancy that you know better
than he does, otherwise you have no business to employ
him. Let him, then, have your implicit confidence
and your exact obedience. What <i>you</i> may consider to
be a trifling matter, may frequently be of the utmost
importance, and may sometimes decide whether the
case shall either end in life or death!</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lice.</i>—It is not very poetical, as many of the grim
facts of everyday life are not, but, unlike a great deal
of poetry, it is unfortunately too true that after a severe
and dangerous illness, especially after a bad attack
of fever, a child’s head frequently becomes infested
with vermin—with lice! It therefore behooves a mother
herself to thoroughly examine, by means of a fine-tooth
comb,<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a> her child’s head, in order to satisfy her
mind that there be no vermin there. As soon as he be
well enough, he ought to resume his regular ablutions—that
is to say, that he must go again regularly into
his tub, and have his head every morning thoroughly
washed with soap and water. A mother ought to be
particular in seeing that the nurse washes the hairbrush
at least once every week; if she does not do so,
the dirty brush which had, during the illness, been used,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1272'>1272</span>might contain the “nits,”—the eggs of the lice,—and
would thus propagate the vermin, as they will, when
on the head of the child, soon hatch. If there be already
lice on the head, in addition to the regular washing
every morning with the soap and water, and after
the head has been thoroughly dried, let the hair be well
and plentifully dressed with camphorated oil—the oil
being allowed to remain on until the next washing on
the following morning. Lice cannot live in oil (more
especially if, as in camphorated oil, camphor be dissolved
in it), and as the camphorated oil will not, in the
slightest degree, injure the hair, it is the best application
that can be used. But as soon as the vermin have
disappeared, let the oil be discontinued, as the <i>natural</i>
oil of the hair is, at other times, the only oil that is required
on the head.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “nit”—the egg of the louse—might be distinguished
from scurf (although to the <i>naked</i> eye it is
very much like it in appearance) by the former fastening
firmly on one of the hairs as a barnacle would on a
rock, and by it not being readily brushed off as scurf
would, which latter (scurf) is always loose.</p>

<p class='c008'>254. <i>My child, in the summer time, is much tormented
with fleas: what are the best remedies?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A small muslin bag, filled with camphor, placed in
the cot or bed, will drive fleas away. Each flea-bite
should, from time to time, be dressed by means of a
camel’s-hair brush, with a drop or two of spirit of camphor,
an ounce bottle of which ought, for the purpose,
to be procured from a chemist. Camphor is also an
excellent remedy to prevent bugs from biting. Bugs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1273'>1273</span>and fleas have a horror of camphor; and well they
might, for it is death to them!</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a famous remedy for the destruction of fleas
manufactured in France, entitled “<i>La Poudre Insecticide</i>,”
which, although perfectly harmless to the human
economy, is utterly destructive to fleas. Bugs are best
destroyed by oil of turpentine; the places they do love
to congregate in should be well saturated, by means of
a brush, with the oil of turpentine. A few dressings
will effectually destroy both them and their young
ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>255. <i>Suppose a child to have had an attack either of
inflammation of the lungs or of bronchitis, and to be
much predisposed to a return: what precautions would
you take to prevent either the one or the other for the
future?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I would recommend him to wear fine flannel instead
of lawn shirts; to wear good lamb’s-wool stockings
<i>above the knees</i>, and good, strong, dry shoes to his
feet; to live, weather permitting, a great part of every
day in the open air; to strengthen his system by good
nourishing food—by an abundance of both milk and
meat (the former especially); to send him, in the autumn,
for a couple of months, to the sea-side; to administer
to him, from time to time, cod-liver oil; in
short, to think only of his health, and to let learning,
until he be stronger, be left alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>I also advise either table salt or bay salt to be added
to the water in which the child is washed with in the
morning, in a similar manner as recommended in answer
to the 123d question.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1274'>1274</span>256. <i>Then do you not advise such a child to be confined
within doors?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If any inflammation be present, or if he have but
just recovered from one, it would be improper to send
him into the open air, but not otherwise, as the fresh
air would be a likely means of strengthening the lungs,
and thereby of preventing an attack of inflammation
for the future. Besides, the more a child is coddled
within doors, the more likely will he be to catch cold,
and to renew the inflammation. If the weather be cold,
yet neither wet nor damp, he ought to be sent out, but
let him be well clothed; and the nurse should have
strict injunctions <i>not</i> to stand about entries, or in any
draughts—indeed, not to stand about at all, but to keep
walking about all the time she is in the open air. Unless
you have a trustworthy nurse, it will be well for
you either to accompany her in her walk with your
child, or merely to allow her to walk with him in the
garden, as you can then keep your eye upon both of
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>257. <i>If a child be either chicken-breasted, or if he
be narrow-chested, are there any means of expanding
and of strengthening his chest?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Learning ought to be put out of the question; attention
must be paid to his health alone, or consumption
will probably mark him as its own! Let him live as
much as possible in the open air; if it be country, so
much the better. Let him rise early in the morning,
and let him go to bed betimes; and if he be old enough
to use the dumb-bells, or, what is better, an india-rubber
chest expander, he should do so daily. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1275'>1275</span>ought also to be encouraged to use two short sticks,
similar to, but heavier than, a policeman’s staff, and to
go, every morning, through regular exercises with
them. As soon as he be old enough, let him have
lessons from a drill-sergeant and from a dancing-master.
Let him be made both to walk and to sit upright, and
let him be kept as much as possible upon a milk diet,<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
and give him as much as he can eat of fresh meat every
day. Cod-liver oil, a teaspoonful or a dessertspoonful,
according to his age, twice a day, is serviceable in these
cases. Stimulants ought to be carefully avoided. In
short, let every means be used to nourish, to strengthen,
and invigorate the system, without at the same time
creating fever. Such a child should be a child of nature;
he ought almost to live in the open air, and throw
his books to the winds. Of what use is learning without
health? In such a case as this you cannot have
both.</p>

<p class='c008'>258. <i>If a child be round-shouldered, or if either of
his shoulder-blades have “grown out,” what had better
be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Many children have either round shoulders, or have
their shoulder-blades grown out, or have their spines
twisted, from growing too fast, from being allowed to
slouch in their gait, and from not having sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1276'>1276</span>nourishing food, such as meat and milk, to support
them while the rapid growth of childhood is going on.</p>

<p class='c008'>If your child be affected as above described, nourish
him well on milk and on farinaceous food, and on meat
once a day, but let milk be his staple diet; he ought,
during the twenty-four hours, to take two or three
pints of new milk. He should almost live in the open
air, and must have plenty of play. If you can so contrive
it, let him live in the country. When tired, let
him lie, for half an hour, two or three times daily, flat
on his back on the carpet. Let him rest at night on a
horse-hair mattress, and not on a feather bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let him have every morning, if it be summer, a
thorough cold water ablution; if it be winter, let the
water be made tepid. Let either two handfuls of table
salt or a handful of bay salt be dissolved in the water.
Let the salt and water stream well over his shoulders
and down his back and loins. Let him be well dried
with a moderately coarse towel, and then let his back
be well rubbed, and his shoulders be thrown back—exercising
them, much in the same manner as in skipping,
for five or ten minutes at a time. Skipping, by-the-by,
is of great use in these cases, whether the child
be either a boy or a girl—using, of course, the rope
backward, and not forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let books be utterly discarded until his shoulders
have become strong, and thus no longer round, and his
shoulder-blades have become straight. It is a painful
sight to see a child stoop like an old man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let him have twice daily a teaspoonful or a dessertspoonful
(according to his age) of cod-liver oil.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1277'>1277</span>When he is old enough, let the drill-sergeant give
him regular lessons, and let the dancing-master be put
in requisition. Let him go through regular gymnastic
exercises, provided they are not of a violent character.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, bear in mind, let there be in these cases no
mechanical restraints—no shoulder-straps, no abominable
stays. Make him straight by natural means—by
making him strong. Mechanical means would only,
by weakening and wasting the muscles, increase the
mischief, and thus the deformity. In this world of
ours there is too much reliance placed on artificial, and
too little on natural means of cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>259. <i>What are the causes of Bow Legs in a child;
and what is the treatment?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Weakness of constitution, poor and insufficient nourishment,
and putting a child, more especially a fat and
heavy one, on his legs too early.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Treatment.</i>—Nourishing food, such as an abundance
of milk, and, if he be old enough, of meat; iron medicines;
cod-liver oil; thorough ablution, every morning,
of the whole body; an abundance of exercise either
on pony, or on donkey, or in carriage, but not, until
his legs be stronger, on foot. If they are much
bowed, it will be necessary to consult an experienced
surgeon.</p>

<p class='c008'>260. <i>If a child, while asleep, “wet his bed,” is there
any method of preventing him from doing so?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let him be held out just before he himself goes to
bed, and again when the family retires to rest. If, at
the time, he be asleep, he will become so accustomed
to it that he will, without awaking, make water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1278'>1278</span>He ought to be made to lie on his side; for, if he be
put on his back, the urine will rest upon an irritable
part of the bladder, and, if he be inclined to wet his
bed, he will not be able to avoid doing so. He must
not be allowed to drink much with his meals, especially
with his supper. Wetting the bed is an infirmity with
some children—they cannot help it. It is, therefore,
cruel to scold and chastise them for it. Occasionally,
however, wetting the bed arises from idleness, in
which case, of course, a little wholesome correction
might be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>A waterproof cloth,<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a> or bed-sheeting, as it is sometimes
called—one yard by three-quarters of a yard—will
effectually preserve the bed from being wetted,
and ought always, on these occasions, to be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mother ought, every morning, to ascertain for
herself whether her child have wet his bed; if he have,
and if unfortunately the waterproof cloth have not
been used, the mattress, sheets, and blankets must be
instantly taken to the kitchen fire and be properly
dried. Inattention to the above has frequently caused
a child to suffer, either from a cold, from a fever, or
from an inflammation; not only so, but if they be not
dried, he is wallowing in filth and in an offensive effluvium.
If both mother and nurse were more attentive
to their duties—in frequently holding a child out,
whether he asks or not—a child wetting his bed would
be the exception, and not, as it frequently is, the rule.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1279'>1279</span>If a child be dirty, you may depend upon it the right
persons to blame are the mother and the nurse, and
not the child!</p>

<p class='c008'>261. <i>If a child should catch Small-pox, what are
the best means to prevent pitting?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He ought to be desired neither to pick nor to rub the
pustules. If he be too young to attend to these directions,
his hands must be secured in bags (just large
enough to hold them), which bags should be fastened
round the wrists. The nails must be cut very close.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cream smeared by means of a feather, frequently in
the day, on the pustules, affords great comfort and
benefit. Tripe-liquor has, for the same purpose, been
strongly recommended. I, myself, in several cases
have tried it, and with the happiest results. It is most
soothing, comforting, and healing to the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>262. <i>Can you tell me of any plan to prevent Chilblains,
or, if a child be suffering from them, to cure
them?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>First, then, the way to prevent them.</i>—Let a child,
who is subject to them, wear, in the winter time, a
square piece of wash-leather over the toes, a pair of
warm lamb’s-wool stockings, and good shoes; but,
above all, let him be encouraged to run about the house
as much as possible, especially before going to bed;
and on no account allow him either to warm his feet
before the fire, or to bathe them in <i>hot</i> water. If the
feet be cold, and the child be too young to take exercise,
then let them be well rubbed with the warm hand.
If adults suffer from chilblains, I have found friction,
night and morning, with horse-hair flesh-gloves, the
best means of preventing them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1280'>1280</span><i>Secondly, the way to cure them.</i>—<i>If they be unbroken</i>,
let them be well rubbed, every night and morning,
with spirits of turpentine and camphorated oil,<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a>
first shaking the bottle, and then let them be covered
with a piece of lint, over which a piece of wash-leather
should be placed. “An excellent chilblain remedy is
made by shaking well together, in a bottle, spirits of
turpentine, white vinegar, and the contents of an egg,
in equal proportion. With this the chilblains should
be rubbed gently whenever they are in a state of irritation,
and until the swelling and redness are dissipated.”<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><i>If they be broken</i>, let a piece of lint be spread with
spermaceti cerate, and be applied, every morning, to
the part, and let a white-bread poultice be used every
night.</p>

<p class='c008'>263. <i>During the winter time my child’s hands, legs,
etc. chap very much: what ought I to do?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let a teacupful of bran be tied up in a muslin bag,
and be put, over night, into either a large water-can
or jug of <i>rain</i> water;<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a> and let this water from the
can or jug be the water he is to be washed with on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1281'>1281</span>following morning, and every morning until the chaps
be cured. As often as water is withdrawn, either from
the water-can or from the jug, let fresh rain water take
its place, in order that the bran may be constantly
soaking in it. The bran in the bag should be renewed
about twice a week.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take particular care to dry the skin well every time
he be washed; then, after each ablution, as well as
every night at bedtime, rub a piece of deer’s suet over
the parts affected: a few dressings will perform a cure.
The deer’s suet may be bought at any of the shops
where venison is sold. Another excellent remedy is
glycerin,<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a> which should be smeared, by means of the
finger or by a camel’s-hair brush, on the parts affected,
two or three times a day. If the child be very young,
it might be necessary to dilute the glycerin with rosewater:
fill a small bottle one-third with glycerin, and
fill up the remaining two-thirds of the bottle with rosewater—shaking
the bottle every time just before using
it. The best soap to use for chapped hands is the
glycerin soap: no other being required.</p>

<p class='c008'>264. <i>What is the best remedy for Chapped Lips?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Cold-cream (which may be procured of any respectable
chemist) is an excellent application for <i>chapped
lips</i>. It ought, by means of the finger, to be frequently
smeared on the parts affected.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1282'>1282</span>265. <i>Have the goodness to inform me of the different
varieties of Worms that infest a child’s bowels?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Principally three—1, The tape-worm; 2, the long
round-worm; and 3, the most frequent of all, the common
thread or maw-worm. The tape-worm infests the
whole course of the bowels, both small and large: the
long round-worm, principally the small bowels, occasionally
the stomach; it sometimes crawls out of the
child’s mouth, causing alarm to the mother; there is,
of course, no danger in its doing so: the common
thread-worm or maw-worm infests the rectum or fundament.</p>

<p class='c008'>266. <i>What are the causes of Worms?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The causes of worms are—weak bowels; bad and improper
food, such as unripe, unsound, or uncooked fruit,
and much green vegetables; pork, especially underdone
pork;<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a> an abundance of sweets; the neglecting of giving
salt in the food.</p>

<p class='c008'>267. <i>What are the symptoms and the treatment of
Worms?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>The symptoms</i> of worms are—emaciation; itching
and picking of the nose; a dark mark under the eyes;
grating, during sleep, of the teeth; starting in the
sleep; foul breath; furred tongue; uncertain appetite—sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1283'>1283</span>voracious, at other times bad, the little patient
sitting down very hungry to his dinner, and before
scarcely tasting a mouthful, the appetite vanishing;
large bowels; colicky pains of the bowels; slimy motions;
itching of the fundament. Tape-worm and
round-worm, more especially the former, are apt, in
children, to produce convulsions. Tape-worm is very
weakening to the constitution, and usually causes great
emaciation and general ill health; the sooner therefore
it is expelled from the bowels the better it will be for the
patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the obscure diseases of children arise from
worms. In all doubtful cases, therefore, this fact should
be borne in mind, in order that a thorough investigation
may be instituted.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to <i>treatment</i>, a medical man ought, of
course, to be consulted. He will soon use means both
to dislodge them, and to prevent a future recurrence of
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me caution a mother never to give her child
patent medicines for the destruction of worms. There
is one favorite quack powder, which is composed principally
of large doses of calomel, and which is quite as
likely to destroy the patient as the worms! No, if your
child have worms, put him under the care of a judicious
medical man, who will soon expel them, without, at the
same time, injuring health and constitution!</p>

<p class='c008'>268. <i>How may Worms be prevented from infesting
a child’s bowels?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Worms generally infest <i>weak</i> bowels; hence, the
moment a child becomes strong worms cease to exist.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1284'>1284</span>The reason why a child is so subject to them is owing
to the improper food which is usually given to him.
When he be stuffed with unsound and with unripe
fruits, with much sweets, with rich puddings, and with
pastry, and when he is oftentimes allowed to eat his
meat <i>without</i> salt, and to <i>bolt</i> his food without chewing
it, is there any wonder that he should suffer from
worms? The way to prevent them is to avoid such
things, and, at the same time, to give him plenty of
salt to his <i>fresh</i> and well-cooked meat. Salt strengthens
and assists digestion, and is absolutely necessary
to the human economy. Salt is emphatically a worm-destroyer.
The truth of this statement may be readily
tested by sprinkling a little salt on the common earthworm.
“What a comfort and real requisite to human
life is salt! It enters into the constituents of the human
blood, and to do without it is wholly impossible.”<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a>
To do without it is wholly impossible! These are
true words. Look well to it, therefore, ye mothers,
and beware of the consequences of neglecting such advice,
and see for yourselves that your children regularly
eat salt with their food. If they neglect eating salt
with their food, <i>they must, of necessity, have worms</i>,
and worms that will eventually injure them and make
them miserable.</p>

<p class='c008'>269. <i>You have a great objection to the frequent administration
of aperient medicines to a child: can you
devise any method to prevent their use?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Although we can scarcely call constipation a disease,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1285'>1285</span>yet it sometimes leads to disease. The frequent
giving of aperients only adds to the stubbornness of
the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have generally found a draught, early every
morning, of <i>cold</i> pump-water, the eating either of
loaf gingerbread or of oatmeal gingerbread, a variety
of animal and vegetable food, ripe sound fruit,
Muscatel raisins, a fig, or an orange after dinner, and,
when he be old enough, <i>coffee</i> and milk instead of <i>tea</i>
and milk, to have the desired effect, more especially if,
for a time, aperients be studiously avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>270. <i>Have you any remarks to make on Rickets?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Rickets is owing to a want of a sufficient quantity
of earthy matter in the bones; hence the bones bend
and twist, and lose their shape, causing deformity.
Rickets generally begins to show itself between the
first and second years of a child’s life. Such children
are generally late in cutting their teeth, and when
the teeth do come, they are bad, deficient of enamel,
discolored, and readily decay. A rickety child is
generally stunted in stature; he has a large head,
with overhanging forehead, or what nurses call a
watery-head-shaped forehead. The fontanelles, or
openings of the head as they are called, are a long
time in closing. A rickety child is usually talented;
his brain seems to thrive at the expense of his general
health. His breast-bone projects out, and the sides of
his chest are flattened—hence he becomes what is called
chicken-breasted or pigeon-breasted; his spine is usually
twisted, so that he is quite awry, and, in a bad case, he
is hump-backed; the ribs, from the twisted spine, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1286'>1286</span>one side bulge out; he is round-shouldered; the long
bones of his body, being soft, bend; he is bow-legged,
knock-kneed, and weak ankled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rickets are of various degrees of intensity, the
hump-backed being among the worst. There are
many mild forms of rickets; weak ankles, knocked-knees,
bowed-legs, chicken-breasts, being among the
latter number. Many a child, who is not exactly
hump-backed, is very round-shouldered, which latter is
also a mild species of rickets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Show me a child that is rickety, and I can generally
prove that it is owing to poor living, more especially
to poor milk. If milk were always genuine, and if a
child had an abundance of it, my belief is that rickets
would be a very rare disease. The importance of genuine
milk is of national importance. We cannot have a
race of strong men and women unless, as children,
they have had a good and plentiful supply of milk. It
is utterly impossible. Milk might well be considered
one of the necessaries of a child’s existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Genuine fresh milk, then, is one of the grand preventives,
as well as one of the best remedies, for rickets.
Many a child would not now have to swallow quantities
of cod-liver oil if previously he had imbibed
quantities of good genuine milk. An insufficient and
a poor supply of milk in childhood sows the seeds of
many diseases, and death often gathers the fruit. Can
it be wondered at, when there is so much poor and
nasty milk in England, that rickets in one shape or
another is so prevalent?</p>

<p class='c008'>When will mothers arouse from their slumbers, rub
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1287'>1287</span>their eyes, and see clearly the importance of the subject?
When will they know that all the symptoms of
rickets I have just enumerated <i>usually</i> proceed from
the want of nourishment, more especially from the want
of genuine and of an abundance of milk? There are,
of course, other means of warding off rickets besides an
abundance of nourishing food, such as thorough ablution,
plenty of air, exercise, play, and sunshine; but of
all these splendid remedies, nourishment stands at the
top of the list.</p>

<p class='c008'>I do not mean to say that rickets <i>always</i> proceeds
from poorness of living—from poor milk. It sometimes
arises from scrofula, and is an inheritance of one
or of both the parents.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rickety children, if not both carefully watched and
managed, frequently, when they become youths, die of
consumption. A mother, who has for some time neglected
the advice I have just given, will often find, to
her grievous cost, that the mischief has, past remedy,
been done, and that it is now “too late!—too late!”</p>

<p class='c008'>271. <i>How may a child be prevented from becoming
Rickety? or, if he be Rickety, how ought he to be
treated?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If a child be predisposed to be rickety, or if he be
actually rickety, attend to the following rules:</p>

<p class='c008'>Let him live well, on good nourishing diet, such as
on tender rump-steaks, cut very fine, and mixed with
mashed potatoes, crumb of bread, and with the gravy
of the meat. Let him have, as I have before advised,
an abundance of good new milk—a quart or three
pints during every twenty-four hours. Let him have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1288'>1288</span>milk in every form—as milk gruel, Du Barry’s Arabica
revalenta made with milk, batter and rice puddings,
suet-pudding, bread and milk, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To harden the bones</i>, let lime-water be added to the
milk (a tablespoonful to each teacupful of milk).</p>

<p class='c008'>Let him have a good supply of fresh, pure, dry air.
He must almost live in the open air—the country, if
practicable, in preference to the town, and the coast in
summer and autumn. Sea bathing and sea breezes
are often, in these cases, of inestimable value.</p>

<p class='c008'>He ought not, at an early age, to be allowed to bear
his weight upon his legs. He must sleep on a horse-hair
mattress, and not on a feather bed. He should
use, every morning, cold baths in the summer, and
tepid baths in the winter, with bay salt (a handful)
dissolved in the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Friction with the hand must, for half an hour at a
time, every night and morning, be sedulously applied
to the back and to the limbs. It is wonderful how
much good in these cases friction does.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strict attention ought to be paid to the rules of
health as laid down in these Conversations. Whatever
is conducive to the general health is preventive
and curative of rickets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Books, if he be old enough to read them, should be
thrown aside; health, and health alone, must be the
one grand object.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best medicines in these cases are a combination
of cod-liver oil and the wine of iron, given in the following
manner: Put a teaspoonful of wine of iron
into a wineglass, half fill the glass with water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1289'>1289</span>sweeten it with a lump or two of sugar, then let a
teaspoonful of cod-liver oil swim on the top; let the
child drink it all down together, twice or three times a
day. An hour after a meal is the <i>best</i> time to give the
medicine, as both iron and cod-liver oil sit better on a
<i>full</i> than on an <i>empty</i> stomach. The child in a short
time will become fond of the above medicine, and will
be sorry when it is discontinued.</p>

<p class='c008'>A case of rickets requires great patience and steady
perseverance; let, therefore, the above plan have a
fair and long-continued trial, and I can then promise
that there will be every probability that great benefit
will be derived from it.</p>

<p class='c008'>272. <i>If a child be subject to a scabby eruption about
the mouth, what is the best local application?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Leave it to Nature. Do not, on any account, apply
any local application to heal it; if you do, you may
produce injury; you may either bring on an attack of
inflammation, or you may throw him into convulsions.
No! This “breaking-out” is frequently a safety-valve,
and must not therefore be needlessly interfered with.
Should the eruption be severe, reduce the child’s diet;
keep him from butter, from gravy, and from fat meat,
or, indeed, for a few days from meat altogether; and
give him mild aperient medicine; but, above all
things, do not quack him either with calomel or with
gray powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>273. <i>Will you have the goodness to describe the
eruption on the face and on the head of a young child,
called Milk-Crust or Running Scall?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Milk-crust is a complaint of very young children—of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1290'>1290</span>those who are cutting their teeth—and as it is a nasty-looking
complaint, and frequently gives a mother a
great deal of trouble, of anxiety, and annoyance, it will
be well that you should know its symptoms, its causes,
and its probable duration.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Symptoms.</i>—When a child is about nine months or
a year old, small pimples are apt to break out around
the ears, on the forehead, and on the head. These
pimples at length become vesicles (that is to say, they
contain water), which run into one large one, break,
and form a nasty dirty-looking yellowish, and sometimes
greenish scab, which scab is moist, indeed, sometimes
quite wet, and gives out a disagreeable odor, and
which is sometimes so large on the head as actually to
form a skull-cap, and so extensive on the face as to form
a mask! These, I am happy to say, are rare cases. The
child’s beauty is, of course, for a time completely
destroyed, and not only his beauty, but his good temper;
for as the eruption causes great irritation and itching,
he is constantly clawing himself, and crying with
annoyance a great part of the day, and sometimes also
of the night, the eruption preventing him from sleeping.
It is not contagious, and soon after he has cut the
whole of his <i>first</i> set of teeth, it will get well, provided
it has not been improperly interfered with.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Causes.</i>—Irritation from teething; stuffing him with
overmuch meat, thus producing a humor, which Nature
tries to get rid of by throwing it out on the surface of
the body, the safest place she could fix on for the purpose,
hence the folly and danger of giving medicines
and applying <i>external</i> applications to drive the eruption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1291'>1291</span>in. “Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in
strange eruptions,”<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a> and cures herself in this way, if
she be not too much interfered with, and if the eruption
be not driven in by injudicious treatment. I have
known in such cases disastrous consequences to follow
over-officiousness and meddlesomeness. Nature is
trying all she can to drive the humor out, while some
wiseacres are doing all they can to drive the humor in.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Duration.</i>—As milk-crust is a tedious affair, and
will require a variety of treatment, it will be necessary
to consult an experienced medical man; and although
he will be able to afford great relief, the child will not,
in all probability, be quite free from the eruption until
he has cut the whole of his first set of teeth—until he
be upwards of two years and a half old—when, with
judicious and careful treatment, it will gradually disappear,
and eventually leave not a trace behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be far better to leave the case alone—to get
well of itself rather than to try to cure the complaint
either by outward applications or by strong internal
medicines; “the remedy is often worse than the disease,”
of this I am quite convinced.</p>

<p class='c008'>274. <i>Have you any advice to give me as to my conduct
toward my medical man?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Give him your entire confidence. Be truthful and
be candid with him. Tell him the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth. Have no reservations;
give him, as near as you can, a plain, unvarnished
statement of the symptoms of the disease. Do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1292'>1292</span>magnify, and do not make too light of any of them.
Be prepared to state the exact time the child first
showed symptoms of illness. If he have had a shivering
fit, however slight, do not fail to tell your medical
man of it. Note the state of the skin; if there be a
“breaking-out,” be it ever so trifling, let it be pointed
out to him. Make yourself acquainted with the quantity
and with the appearance of the urine, taking care to
have a little of it saved, in case the doctor may wish to
see and examine it. Take notice of the state of the
motions—their number during the twenty-four hours,
their color, their smell, and their consistence, keeping
one for his inspection. Never leave any of these
questions to be answered by a servant; a mother is the
proper person to give the necessary and truthful
answers, which answers frequently decide the fate of
the patient. Bear in mind, then, a mother’s untiring
care and love, attention and truthfulness, frequently
decide whether, in a serious illness, the little fellow
shall live or die! Fearful responsibility!</p>

<p class='c008'>A medical man has arduous duties to perform;
smooth, therefore, his path as much as you can, and
you will be amply repaid by the increased good he will
be able to do your child. Strictly obey a doctor’s
orders—in diet, in medicine, in everything. Never
throw obstacles in his way. Never omit any of his
suggestions; for depend upon it, that if he be a sensible
man, directions, however slight, ought never to
be neglected; bear in mind, with a judicious medical
man,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1293'>1293</span>“That nothing walks with aimless feet.”<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If the case be severe, requiring a second opinion,
never of your own accord call in a physician without
first consulting and advising with your own medical
man. It would be an act of great discourtesy to do so.
Inattention to the foregoing advice has frequently
caused injury to the patient, and heart-burnings and
ill will among doctors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speak, in the presence of your child, with respect
and kindness of your medical man, so that the former
may look upon the latter as a friend—as one who will
strive, with God’s blessing, to relieve his pain and suffering.
Remember the increased power of doing good
the doctor will have if the child be induced to like,
instead of dislike, him. Not only be careful that you
yourself speak before your child respectfully and kindly
of the medical man, but see that your domestics do so
likewise; and take care that they are never allowed to
frighten your child, as many silly servants do, by saying
that they will send for the doctor, who will either
give him nasty medicine, or will perform some cruel
operation upon him. A nurse-maid should, then, never
for one moment be permitted to make a doctor an
object of terror or of dislike to a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>Send, whenever it be practicable, for your doctor
<i>early</i> in the morning, as he will then make his arrangements
accordingly, and can by daylight better ascertain
the nature of the complaint, more especially if it be a
skin disease. It is utterly impossible for him to form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1294'>1294</span>a correct opinion of the nature of a “breaking-out”
either by gas or by candle-light. If the illness come on
at night, particularly if it be ushered in either with a
severe shivering, or with any other urgent symptom,
no time should be lost, be it night or day, in sending
for him.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>WARM BATHS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>275. <i>Have the goodness to mention the complaints of
a child for which warm baths are useful?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>1. Convulsions; 2. Pains in the bowels, known by
the child drawing up his legs, screaming violently, etc.;
3. Restlessness from teething; 4. Flatulence. The
warm bath acts as a fomentation to the stomach and
the bowels, and gives ease where the usual remedies
do not rapidly relieve.</p>

<p class='c008'>276. <i>Will you mention the precautions and the rules
to be observed in putting a child into a warm bath?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Carefully ascertain before he be immersed in the bath
that the water be neither too hot nor too cold. Carelessness,
or over-anxiety to put him in the water as quickly
as possible, has frequently, from his being immersed in
the bath when the water was too hot, caused him great
pain and suffering. From 96 to 98 degrees of Fahrenheit
is the proper temperature of a warm bath. If it
be necessary to add fresh warm water, let him be either
removed the while, or let it not be put in when very
hot; for if boiling water be added to increase the heat
of the bath, it naturally ascends, and may scald him.
Again, let the fresh water be put in at as great a distance
from him as possible. The usual time for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1295'>1295</span>to remain in a bath is a quarter of an hour or twenty
minutes. Let the chest and the bowels be rubbed with
the hand while he is in the bath. Let him be immersed
in the bath as high up as the neck, taking care that he
be the while supported under the armpits, and that his
head be also rested. As soon as he comes out of the
bath he ought to be carefully but quickly rubbed dry;
and, if it be necessary to keep up the action on the skin,
he should be put to bed, between the blankets; or, if
the desired relief has been obtained, between the sheets,
which ought to have been previously warmed, where,
most likely, he will fall into a sweet refreshing sleep.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>WARM EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>277. <i>In case of a child suffering pain either in his
stomach or in his bowels, or in case he has a feverish
cold, can you tell me of the best way of applying heat
to them?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>In pain, either of the stomach or of the bowels, there
is nothing usually affords greater or speedier relief
than the <i>external</i> application of heat. The following
are four different methods of applying heat: 1. A bag
of hot salt—that is to say, powdered table salt—put
either into the oven or into a frying-pan, and thus
made hot, and placed in a flannel bag, and then applied,
as the case may be, either to the stomach or to the
bowels. Hot salt is an excellent remedy for these
pains. 2. An india-rubber hot water bottle,<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a> half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1296'>1296</span>filled with hot water—it need not be boiling—applied
to the stomach or to the bowels will afford great comfort.
3. Another, and an excellent remedy for these
cases, is a hot bran poultice. The way to make it is
as follows: Stir bran into a vessel containing either a
pint or a quart (according to size of poultice required)
of boiling water, until it be of the consistence of a nice
soft poultice, then put it into a flannel bag and apply it
to the part affected. When cool, dip it from time to time
in <i>hot</i> water. 4. In case a child has a feverish cold,
especially if it be attended, as it sometimes is, with
pains in the bowels, the following is a good external
application: Take a yard of flannel, fold it three widths,
then dip it in very hot water, wring it out tolerably
dry, and apply it evenly and neatly round and round
the bowels; over this, and to keep it in its place and
to keep in the moisture, put on a <i>dry</i> flannel bandage,
four yards long and four inches wide. If it be put on
at bedtime, it ought to remain on all night. Where
there are children, it is desirable to have the yard of
flannel and the flannel bandage in readiness, and then
a mother will be prepared for emergencies. Either the
one or the other, then, of the above applications will
usually, in pains of the stomach and bowels, afford
great relief. There is one great advantage of the
<i>external</i> application of heat—it can never do harm; if
there be inflammation, it will do good; if there be
either cramps or spasms of the stomach, it will be serviceable;
if there be colic, it will be one of the best remedies
that can be used; if it be a feverish cold, by throwing
the child into a perspiration, it will be useful.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1297'>1297</span>It is well for a mother to know how to make a white-bread
poultice; and as the celebrated Abernethy was
noted for his poultices, I will give you his directions,
and in his very words: “Scald out a basin, for you can
never make a good poultice unless you have perfectly
boiling water, then, having put in some hot water,
throw in coarsely crumbled bread, and cover it with a
plate. When the bread has soaked up as much water
as it will imbibe, drain off the remaining water, and
there will be left a light pulp. Spread it a third of an
inch thick on folded linen, and apply it when of the
temperature of a warm bath. It may be said that this
poultice will be very inconvenient if there be no lard
in it, for it will soon get dry; but this is the very thing
you want, and it can easily be moistened by dropping
warm water on it, while a greasy poultice will be
moist, but not wet.”<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'>ACCIDENTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>278. <i>Supposing a child to cut his finger, what is the
best application?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is nothing better than tying it up with rag in
its blood, as nothing is more healing than blood. Do
not wash the blood away, but apply the rag at once,
taking care that no foreign substance be left in the
wound. If there be either glass or dirt in it, it will,
of course, be necessary to bathe the cut in warm water,
to get rid of it before the rag be applied. Some mothers
use either salt, or Fryar’s Balsam, or turpentine to
a fresh wound; these plans are cruel and unnecessary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1298'>1298</span>and frequently make the cut difficult to heal. If it
bleed immoderately, sponge the wound freely with cold
water. If it be a severe cut, surgical aid, of course,
will be required.</p>

<p class='c008'>279. <i>If a child receive a blow, causing a bruise,
what had better be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately smear a small lump of <i>fresh</i> butter on
the part affected, and renew it every few minutes for
two or three hours; this is an old-fashioned, but a very
good remedy. Olive oil may—if <i>fresh</i> butter be not
at hand—be used, or soak a piece of brown paper in
one-third of French brandy, and two-thirds of water,
and immediately apply it to the part; when dry renew
it. Either of these simple plans—the butter plan is
the best—will generally prevent both swelling and
disfiguration.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>A “Black Eye.”</i>—If a child, or indeed any one else,
receive a blow over the eye, which is likely to cause a
“black eye,” there is no remedy superior to, nor more
likely to prevent one, than well buttering the parts for
two or three inches around the eye with fresh butter,
renewing it every few minutes for the space of an hour
or two; if such be well and perseveringly done, the
disagreeable appearance of a “black eye” will in all
probability be prevented. A capital remedy for a
“black eye” is the arnica lotion:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Tincture of Arnica, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, seven ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Lotion. The eye to be bathed, by means of a soft piece
of linen rag, with this lotion frequently; and, between times, let a
piece of linen rag, wetted in the lotion, be applied to the eye, and be
fastened in its place by means of a bandage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1299'>1299</span>The white lily leaf, soaked in brandy, is another excellent
remedy for the bruises of a child. Gather the
white lily blossoms when in full bloom, and pot them
in a wide-mouthed bottle of brandy, cork the bottle,
and it will then always be ready for use. Apply a
leaf to the part affected, and bind it on either with a
bandage or with a handkerchief. The white lily root
sliced is another valuable external application for
bruises.</p>

<p class='c008'>280. <i>If a child fall upon his head and be stunned,
what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If he fall upon his head and be stunned, he will look
deadly pale, very much as if he had fainted. He will
in a few minutes, in all probability, regain his consciousness.
Sickness frequently supervenes, which makes
the case more serious, it being a proof that injury,
more or less severe, has been done to the brain; send,
therefore, instantly, for a medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the mean time, loosen both his collar and neckerchief,
lay him flat on his back, sprinkle cold water upon
his face, open the windows so as to admit plenty of
fresh air, and do not let people crowd around him, nor
shout at him, as some do, to make him speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>While he is in an unconscious state, do not on any
account whatever allow a drop of blood to be taken
from him, either by leeches or by bleeding; if you do,
he will probably never rally, but will most likely sleep
“the sleep that knows no waking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>281. <i>A nurse sometimes drops an infant and injures
his back; what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly send for a surgeon; omitting to have proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1300'>1300</span>advice in such a case has frequently made a child
a cripple for life. A nurse frequently, when she has
dropped her little charge, is afraid to tell her mistress;
the consequences might then be deplorable. If ever a
child scream violently without any assignable cause,
and the mother is not able for some time to pacify him,
the safer plan is that she send for a doctor, in order
that he might strip and carefully examine him; much
after-misery might often be averted if this plan were
more frequently followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>282. <i>Have you any remarks to make and directions
to give on accidental poisoning by lotions, by liniments,
etc.?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is a culpable practice of either a mother or nurse
to leave <i>external</i> applications within the reach of a
child. It is also highly improper to put a mixture and
an <i>external</i> application (such as a lotion or a liniment)
on the same tray or on the same mantle-piece. Many
liniments contain large quantities of opium, a teaspoonful
of which would be likely to cause the death of a
child. “Hartshorn and oil,” too, has frequently been
swallowed by children, and in several instances has
caused death. Many lotions contain sugar of lead,
which is also poisonous. There is not, fortunately,
generally sufficient lead in the lotion to cause death;
but if there be not enough to cause death, there may
be more than enough to make the child very poorly.
All these accidents occur from disgraceful carelessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mother or a nurse ought <i>always</i>, before administering
a dose of medicine to a child, to read the label
on the bottle; by adopting this simple plan many serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1301'>1301</span>accidents and much after-misery might be averted.
Again, I say let every lotion, every liniment, and indeed
everything for <i>external</i> use, be either locked up or be
put out of the way, and far away from all medicine
that is given by the mouth. <i>This advice admits of no
exception.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If your child has swallowed a portion of a liniment
containing opium, instantly send for a medical man.
In the mean time, force a strong mustard emetic (composed
of two teaspoonfuls of flour of mustard, mixed
in half a teacupful of warm water) down his throat.
Encourage the vomiting by afterward forcing him to
swallow warm water. Tickle the throat either with
your finger or with a feather. Souse him alternately
in a hot and then in a cold bath. Dash cold water on
his head and face. Throw open the windows. Walk
him about in the open air. Rouse him by slapping
him, by pinching him, and by shouting to him; rouse
him, indeed, by every means in your power, for if you
allow him to go to sleep, it will, in all probability, be
the sleep that knows no waking!</p>

<p class='c008'>If a child has swallowed “hartshorn and oil,” force
him to drink vinegar and water, lemon-juice and water,
barley-water, and thin gruel.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he have swallowed a lead lotion, give him a mustard
emetic, and then vinegar and water, sweetened
either with honey or with sugar, to drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>283. <i>Are not Lucifer Matches poisonous?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly, they are very poisonous; it is therefore
desirable that they should be put out of the reach of
children. A mother ought to be very strict with servants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1302'>1302</span>on this head. Moreover, lucifer matches are not
only poisonous but dangerous, as a child might set
himself on fire with them. A case bearing on the
subject has just come under my own observation. A
little boy, three years old, was left alone for two or
three minutes, during which time he obtained possession
of a lucifer match, and struck a light by striking
the match against the wall. Instantly there was a
blaze. Fortunately for him, in his fright, he threw the
match on the floor. His mother, at this moment, entered
the room. If his clothes had taken fire, which
they might have done, had he not thrown the match
away, or if his mother had not been so near at hand,
he would, in all probability, have either been severely
burned, or have been burned to death.</p>

<p class='c008'>284. <i>If a child’s clothes take fire, what ought to be
done to extinguish them?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Lay him on the floor, then roll him either in the rug
or in the carpet, or in the door-mat, or in any thick
article of dress you may either have on, or have at hand—if
it be woolen, so much the better; or throw him
down, and roll him over and over on the floor, as by
excluding the atmospheric air, the flame will go out:
hence, the importance of a mother cultivating presence
of mind. If parents were better prepared for such
emergencies, such horrid disfigurations and frightful
deaths would be less frequent.</p>

<p class='c008'>You ought to have a proper fire-guard before the
nursery grate, and should be strict in not allowing your
child to play with fire. If he still persevere in playing
with it when he has been repeatedly cautioned not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1303'>1303</span>do so, he should be punished for his temerity. If anything
would justify corporal chastisement, it would
surely be such an act of disobedience. There are only
two acts of disobedience that I would flog a child for—namely,
the playing with fire and the telling of a lie!
If after various warnings and wholesome corrections
he still persists, it would be well to let him slightly
taste the pain of his doing so, either by holding his
hand for a moment very near the fire, or by allowing
him to slightly touch either the hot bar of the grate or
the flame of the candle. Take my word for it, the
above plan will effectually cure him—he will never do
it again! It would be well for the children of the poor
to have pinafores made either of woolen or of stuff
materials. The dreadful deaths from burning, which
so often occur in winter, too frequently arise from
<i>cotton</i> pinafores first taking fire.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>If all dresses, after being washed, and just before
being dried, were, for a short time, soaked in a solution
of tungstate of soda, such clothes, when dried, would
be perfectly fire-proof.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tungstate of soda may be used either with or without
starch; but full directions for the using of it will,
at the time of purchase, be given by the chemist.</p>

<p class='c008'>285. <i>Is a burn more dangerous than a scald?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A burn is generally more serious than a scald.
Burns and scalds are more dangerous on the body,
especially on the chest, than either on the face or on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1304'>1304</span>the extremities. The younger the child, of course, the
greater is the danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scalds, both of the mouth and of the throat, from a
child drinking boiling water from the spout of a tea-kettle,
are most dangerous. A poor person’s child is,
from the unavoidable absence of the mother, sometimes
shut up in the kitchen by himself, and being very
thirsty, and no other water being at hand, he is tempted
in his ignorance to drink from the tea-kettle: if the
water be unfortunately boiling, it will most likely
prove to him to be a fatal draught!</p>

<p class='c008'>286. <i>What are the best immediate applications to a
scald or to a burn?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is nothing more efficacious than flour. It
ought to be thickly applied, over the part affected, and
should be kept in its place either with a rag and a
bandage, or with strips of old linen. If this be done,
almost instantaneous relief will be experienced, and
the burn or the scald, if superficial, will soon be well.
The advantage of flour as a remedy is this, that it is
always at hand. I have seen some extensive burns
and scalds cured by the above simple plan. Another
excellent remedy is cotton wool. The burn or the scald
ought to be enveloped in it; layer after layer should
be applied until it be several inches thick. The cotton wool
must not be removed for several days.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a> These
two remedies, flour and cotton wool, may be used in
conjunction; that is to say, the flour may be thickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1305'>1305</span>applied to the scald or to the burn, and the cotton wool
over all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prepared lard—that is to say, lard without salt<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a>—is
an admirable remedy for burns and for scalds. The
advantages of lard are: (1) It is almost always at
hand; (2) It is very cooling, soothing, and unirritating
to the part, and it gives almost immediate freedom from
pain; (3) It effectually protects and sheathes the burn
or the scald from the air; (4) It is readily and easily
applied: all that has to be done is to spread the lard
either on pieces of old linen rag, or on lint, and then to
apply them smoothly to the parts affected, keeping
them in their places by means of bandages—which
bandages may be readily made from either old linen or
calico shirts. Dr. John Packard, of Philadelphia, was
the first to bring this remedy for burns and scalds before
the public—he having tried it in numerous instances,
and with the happiest results. I myself have,
for many years, been in the habit of prescribing lard
as a dressing for blisters, and with the best effects. I
generally advise equal parts of prepared lard and of
spermaceti cerate to be blended together to make an
ointment. The spermaceti cerate gives a little more
consistence to the lard, which, in warm weather, especially,
is a great advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another valuable remedy for burns is, “carron oil;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1306'>1306</span>which is made by mixing equal parts of linseed oil and
lime-water together in a bottle, and shaking it up before
using it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cold applications, such as cold water, cold vinegar
and water, and cold lotions, are most injurious, and, in
many cases, even dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scraped potatoes, sliced cucumber, salt, and spirits
of turpentine, have all been recommended; but, in my
practice, nothing has been so efficacious as the remedies
above enumerated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do not wash the wound, and do not dress it more
frequently than every <i>other</i> day. If there be much
discharge, let it be gently sopped up with soft old linen
rag; but do not, <i>on any</i> account, let the burn be rubbed
or roughly handled. I am convinced that, in the majority
of cases, wounds are too frequently dressed, and
that the washing of wounds prevents the healing of
them. “It is a great mistake,” said Ambrose Paré, “to
dress ulcers too often, and to wipe their surfaces clean,
for thereby we not only remove the useless excrement,
which is the mud or sanies of ulcers, but also the matter
which forms the flesh. Consequently, for these
reasons, ulcers should not be dressed too often.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The burn or the scald may, after the first two days,
if severe, require different dressings; but, if it be severe,
the child ought of course to be immediately placed
under the care of a surgeon.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the scald be either on the leg or on the foot, a common
practice is to take the shoe and the stocking off;
in this operation, the skin is also at the same time very
apt to be removed. Now, both the shoe and the stocking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1307'>1307</span>ought to be slit up, and thus be taken off, so that
neither unnecessary pain nor mischief may be caused.</p>

<p class='c008'>287. <i>If a bit of quicklime should accidentally enter
the eye of my child, what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly, but tenderly remove, either by means of
a camel’s-hair brush or by a small spill of paper, any
bit of lime that may adhere to the ball of the eye, or
that may be within the eye or on the eyelashes; then
well bathe the eye (allowing a portion to enter it) with
vinegar and water—one part of vinegar to three parts
of water, that is to say, a quarter fill a clean half-pint
medicine bottle with vinegar and then fill it up with
spring water, and it will be ready for use. Let the eye
be bathed for at least a quarter of an hour with it. The
vinegar will neutralize the lime, and will rob it of its
burning properties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having bathed the eye with the vinegar and water
for a quarter of an hour, bathe it for another quarter of
an hour simply with a little warm water; after which,
drop into the eye two or three drops of the best sweet
oil, put on an eye-shade made of three thicknesses of
linen rag, covered with green silk, and then do nothing
more until the doctor arrives.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the above rules be not <i>promptly</i> and <i>properly</i> followed
out, the child may irreparably lose his eyesight;
hence the necessity of a <i>popular</i> work of this kind, to
tell a mother, provided <i>immediate</i> assistance cannot be
obtained, what ought <i>instantly</i> to be done; for
moments, in such a case, are precious.</p>

<p class='c008'>While doing all that I have just recommended, let a
surgeon be sent for, as a smart attack of inflammation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1308'>1308</span>of the eye is very apt to follow the burn of lime; but
which inflammation will, provided the <i>previous</i> directions
have been <i>promptly</i> and <i>efficiently</i> followed out,
with appropriate treatment, soon subside.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above accident is apt to occur to a child who is
standing near a building when the slacking of quicklime
is going on, and where portions of lime, in the
form of powder, are flying about the air. It would be
well not to allow a child to stand about such places, as
prevention is always better than cure. <i>Quicklime</i> is
sometimes called <i>caustic lime</i>: it well deserves its
name, for it is a <i>burning lime</i>, and if proper means be
not promptly used, will soon burn away the sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>288. “<i>What is to be done in the case of Choking?</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly put your finger into the throat and feel if
the substance be within reach; if it be food, force it
down, and thus liberate the breathing; should it be a
hard substance, endeavor to hook it out; if you cannot
reach it, give a good smart blow or two with the flat
of the hand on the back; or, as recommended by a
contributor to the <cite>Lancet</cite>, on the chest, taking care to
“seize the little patient, and place him between your
knees side ways, and in this or some other manner to
<i>compress the abdomen</i> [the belly], otherwise the power
of the blow will be lost by the yielding of the abdominal
parietes [walls of the belly], and the respiratory
effort will not be produced.” If that does not have the
desired effect, tickle the throat with your finger, so as
to insure immediate vomiting, and the consequent
ejection of the offending substance.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1309'>1309</span>289. <i>Should my child be bitten by a dog supposed to
be mad, what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly well rub for the space of five of ten seconds—<i>seconds</i>,
<i>not</i> minutes—a stick of nitrate of silver (lunar
caustic) into the wound. The stick of lunar caustic
should be pointed, like a cedar-pencil for writing, in
order the more thoroughly to enter the wound.<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a> This,
if properly done directly after the bite, will effectually
prevent hydrophobia. The nitrate of silver acts not
only as a caustic to the part, but it appears effectually
to neutralize the poison, and thus by making the virus
perfectly innocuous is a complete antidote. If it be
either the lip, or the parts near the eye, or the wrist,
that have been bitten, it is far preferable to apply the
caustic than to cut the part out; as the former is neither
so formidable, nor so dangerous, nor so disfiguring as
the latter, and yet it is equally as efficacious. I am
indebted to the late Mr. Youatt, the celebrated veterinary
surgeon, for this valuable antidote or remedy for
the <i>prevention</i> of the most horrible, heart-rending, and
incurable disease known. Mr. Youatt had an immense
practice among dogs as well as among horses. He
was a keen observer of disease, and a dear lover of his
profession, and he had paid great attention to rabies—dog
madness. He and his assistants had been repeatedly
bitten by rabid dogs; but knowing that he was in
possession of an infallible preventive remedy, he never
dreaded the wounds inflicted either upon himself or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1310'>1310</span>upon his assistants. Mr. Youatt never knew lunar
caustic, if properly and <i>immediately</i> applied, to fail. It
is, of course, only a preventive. If hydrophobia be
once developed in the human system, no antidote has
ever yet, for this fell and intractable disease, been
found.</p>

<p class='c008'>While walking the London Hospitals, upwards of
thirty-five years ago, I received an invitation from Mr.
Youatt to attend a lecture on rabies—dog madness.
He had, during the lecture, a dog present laboring
under <i>incipient</i> madness. In a day or two after the
lecture, he requested me and other students to call at
his infirmary and see the dog, as the disease was at that
time fully developed. We did so, and found the poor
animal raving mad—frothing at the mouth, and snapping
at the iron bars of his prison. I was particularly
struck with a peculiar brilliancy and wildness of the
dog’s eyes. He seemed as though, with affright and
consternation, he beheld objects unseen by all around.
It was pitiful to witness his frightened and anxious
countenance. Death soon closed the scene!</p>

<p class='c008'>I have thought it my duty to bring the value of
lunar caustic as a preventive of hydrophobia prominently
before your notice, and to pay a tribute of respect
to the memory of Mr. Youatt—a man of talent and
genius.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never kill a dog supposed to be mad who has bitten
either a child, or any one else, until it has, past all
doubt, been ascertained whether he be really mad or
not. He ought, of course, to be tied up, and be carefully
watched, and be prevented the while from biting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1311'>1311</span>any one else. The dog, by all means, should be allowed
to live at least for some weeks, as the fact of his
remaining will be the best guarantee that there is no
fear of the bitten child having caught hydrophobia.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a foolish prejudice abroad, that a dog, be he
mad or not, who has bitten a person ought to be <i>immediately</i>
destroyed; that although the dog be not at the
time mad, but should at a future period become so, the
person who had been bitten when the dog was <i>not</i> mad,
would, when the dog became mad, have hydrophobia!
It seems almost absurd to bring the subject forward;
but the opinion is so very general and deep rooted, that
I think it well to declare that there is not the slightest
foundation of truth in it, but that it is a ridiculous
fallacy!</p>

<p class='c008'>A cat sometimes goes mad, and its bite may cause
hydrophobia; indeed, the bite of a mad cat is more
dangerous than the bite of a mad dog. A bite from a
mad cat ought to be treated precisely in the same manner—namely,
with the lunar caustic—as for a mad dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bite either from a dog or from a cat <i>who is not mad</i>,
from a cat especially, is often venomous and difficult to
heal. The best application is <i>immediately</i> to apply a
large hot white-bread poultice to the part, and to renew
it every four hours; and, if there be much pain in the
wound, to well foment the part, every time before applying
the poultice, with a hot chamomile and poppy-head
fomentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scratches of a cat are best treated by smearing, and
that freely and continuously for an hour, and then afterward
at longer intervals, fresh butter on the part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1312'>1312</span>affected. If fresh butter be not at hand, fresh lard—that
is to say, lard <i>without</i> salt—will answer the purpose.
If the pain of the scratch be very intense, foment
the part affected with hot water, and then apply a hot
white-bread poultice, which should be frequently renewed.</p>

<p class='c008'>290. <i>What is the best application in case of a sting
either from a bee or from a wasp?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Extract the sting, if it have been left behind, either
by means of a pair of dressing forceps, or by the pressure
of the hollow of a small key—a watch-key will
answer the purpose; then, a little blue (which is used
in washing) moistened with water, should be immediately
applied to the part; or, apply a few drops of
solution of potash,<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c014'><sup>[273]</sup></a> or “apply moist snuff or tobacco,
rubbing it well in,”<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c014'><sup>[274]</sup></a> and renew from time to time either
of them: if either of these be not at hand, either honey,
or treacle, or fresh butter, will answer the purpose.
Should there be much swelling or inflammation, apply
a hot white-bread poultice, and renew it frequently.
In eating apricots, or peaches, or other fruit, they ought
to, beforehand, be carefully examined, in order to ascertain
that no wasp is lurking in them; otherwise, it
may sting the throat, and serious consequences will
ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>291. <i>If a child receive a fall, causing the skin to be
grazed, can you tell me of a good application?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>You will find gummed paper an excellent remedy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1313'>1313</span>the way of preparing it is as follows: Apply evenly,
by means of a small brush, thick mucilage of gum arabic
to cap paper; hang it up to dry, and keep it ready for
use. When wanted, cut a portion as large as may be
requisite, then moisten it with your tongue, in the same
manner you would a postage stamp, and apply it to
the grazed part. It may be removed when necessary
by simply wetting it with water. The part in two or
three days will be well. There is usually a margin of
gummed paper sold with postage stamps; this will
answer the purpose equally well. If the gummed
paper be not at hand, then frequently, for the space of
an hour or two, smear the part affected with fresh
butter.</p>

<p class='c008'>292. <i>In case of a child swallowing by mistake either
laudanum, or paregoric, or Godfrey’s Cordial, or any
other preparation of opium, what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Give, <i>as quickly as possible</i>, a strong mustard
emetic; that is to say, mix two teaspoonfuls of flour of
mustard in half a teacupful of water, and force it down
his throat. If free vomiting be not induced, tickle the
upper part of the swallow with a feather; drench the
little patient’s stomach with large quantities of warm
water. As soon as it can be obtained from a druggist,
give him the following emetic draught:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Sulphate of Zinc, one scruple;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Simple Syrup, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, seven drachms:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Draught.</p>

<p class='c008'>Smack his buttocks and his back; walk him, or lead
him, or carry him about in the fresh air; shake him by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1314'>1314</span>the shoulders; pull his hair; tickle his nostrils; shout
and holla in his ears; plunge him into a warm bath
and then into a cold bath alternately; well sponge his
head and face with cold water; dash cold water on his
head, face, and neck; and do not, on any account,
until the effects of the opiate are gone off, allow him to
go to sleep; if you do, he will never wake again!
While doing all these things, of course, you ought to
lose no time in sending for a medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>293. <i>Have you any observations to make on parents
allowing the Deadly Nightshade—the Atropa Belladonna—to
grow in their gardens?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I wish to caution you <i>not</i> on any account to allow
the Belladonna—the Deadly Nightshade—to grow in
your garden. The whole plant—root, leaves, and berries—is
poisonous; and the berries, being attractive to
the eye, are very alluring to children.</p>

<p class='c008'>294. <i>What is the treatment of poisoning by Belladonna?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly send for a medical man; but, in the mean
time, give an emetic—a mustard emetic;—mix two
teaspoonfuls of flour of mustard in half a teacupful of
warm water, and force it down the child’s throat; then
drench him with warm water, and tickle the upper
part of his swallow either with a feather or with the
finger, to make him sick; as the grand remedy is an
emetic to bring up the offending cause. If the emetic
have not acted sufficiently, the medical man when he
arrives may deem it necessary to use the stomach-pump;
but remember not a moment must be lost, for
moments are precious in a case of belladonna poisoning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1315'>1315</span>in giving a mustard emetic, and repeating it again and
again until the enemy be dislodged. Dash cold water
upon his head and face; the best way of doing which
is by means of a large sponge, holding his head and
his face over a wash-hand basin, half filled with cold
water, and filling the sponge from the basin, and
squeezing it over his head and face, allowing the water
to continuously stream over them for an hour or two,
or until the effects of the poison have passed away.
This sponging of the head and face is very useful in
poisoning by opium, as well as in poisoning by belladonna;
indeed, the treatment of poisoning by the one
is very similar to the treatment of poisoning by the
other. I, therefore, for the further treatment of poisoning
by belladonna, beg to refer you to a previous Conversation
on the treatment of poisoning by opium.</p>

<p class='c008'>295. <i>Should a child put either a pea or a bead, or
any other foreign substance, up the nose, what ought
to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Do not attempt to extract it yourself, or you might
push it farther in, but send instantly for a surgeon,
who will readily remove it, either with a pair of forceps,
or by means of a bent probe, or with a director.
If it be a pea, and it be allowed for any length of time
to remain in, it will swell, and will thus become difficult
to extract, and may produce great irritation and
inflammation. A child ought not to be allowed to
play with peas or with beads (unless the beads are on
a string), as he is apt, for amusement, to push them
up his nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>296. <i>If a child have put either a pea, a bean, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1316'>1316</span>bead, a cherry-stone, or any other smooth substance,
into his ear, what ought to be done to remove it?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Turn his head on one side, in order to let the ear
with the pea or bead in it be undermost, then give
with the flat of your hand two or three sharp, sudden
slaps or boxes on the other, or <i>upper</i>most ear, and
most likely the offending substance will drop out.
Poking at the ear will, in the majority of cases, only
send the substance farther in, and will make it more
difficult (if the above simple plan does not succeed)
for the medical man to remove. The surgeon will, in
all probability, syringe the ear; therefore, have a supply
of warm water in readiness for him, in order that
no time may be lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>297. <i>If an earwig, or any other living thing, should
get into the ear of a child, what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Lay the child on his side, the affected ear being uppermost,
and fill the ear, from a teaspoon, with either
water or sweet oil. The water or oil will carry the
living thing, whatever it be, out of the ear, and the
child is at once relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>298. <i>If a child swallow a piece of broken glass,
what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Avoid purgatives, as the free action on the bowels
would be likely to force the spiculæ of glass into the
mucous membrane of the bowels, and thus would
wound them, and might cause ulceration, and even
death. “The object of treatment will be to allow
them to pass through the intestines well enveloped by
the other contents of the tube; and for this purpose a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1317'>1317</span>solid farinaceous diet should be ordered, and purgatives
scrupulously avoided.”<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>299. <i>If a child swallow a pin, what should be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Treat him as for broken glass. Give him no aperients,
or it might, in action, force the pin into the bowel. I
have known more than one instance where a child, after
swallowing a pin, to have voided it in his motion.</p>

<p class='c008'>300. <i>If a child swallow a coin of any kind, is danger
likely to ensue, and what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is, as a rule, no danger. A dose or two of
castor oil will be all that is usually necessary. The
evacuations ought to be carefully examined until the
coin be discovered. I once knew a child swallow a
penny-piece, and pass it in his motions.</p>

<p class='c008'>301. <i>If a child, while playing with a small coin
(such as either a threepenny or a fourpenny piece),
or any other substance, should toss it into his mouth,
and inadvertently allow it to enter the windpipe, what
ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Take hold of him by the legs, allowing his head to
hang downward; then give him, with the palm of
your hand, several sharp blows on his back, and you
may have the good fortune to see the coin coughed
out of his mouth. Of course, if this plan does not
succeed, send instantly for a medical man.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>ABLUTION, Etc.</h4>

<p class='c018'>302. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the Ablution
of boys and girls?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>How is it that a mother thinks it absolutely necessary
(which it really is) that her babe’s <i>whole</i> body
should every morning be washed; and yet who does
not deem it needful that her girl or boy of twelve
years old, should go through the process of daily and
<i>thorough</i> ablution? If the one case be necessary,
sure I am that the other is equally if not more needful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorough ablution of the body every morning at
least is essential to health. I maintain that no one
can be in the enjoyment of perfect health who does
not keep his skin—the whole of his skin—clean. In
the absence of cleanliness, a pellicle forms on the skin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1319'>1319</span>which engenders disease. Moreover, a person who
does not keep his skin clean is more susceptible of
contracting contagious disease, such as small-pox, typhus
fever, cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorough ablution of the body is a grand requisite
of health. I maintain that no one can be perfectly
healthy unless he thoroughly wash his body—the
whole of his body; if filth accumulate, which, if not
washed off, it is sure to do, disease must, as a matter
of course, follow. Besides, ablution is a delightful
process; it makes one feel fresh and sweet, and young
and healthy; it makes the young look handsome and
the old look young! Thorough ablution might truly
be said both to renovate and to rejuvenize! A scrupulously
clean skin is one of the grand distinctive
characteristics both of a lady and of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dirty people are not only a nuisance to themselves,
but to all around; they are not only a nuisance, but a
danger, as their dirty bodies are apt to carry from place
to place contagious diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is important that parts that are covered should
be kept cleaner than parts exposed to the air, as dirt
is more apt to fester in dark places; besides, parts exposed
to the air have the advantage of the air’s sweetening
properties; air acts as a bath, and purifies the
skin amazingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is desirable to commence a complete system of
washing early in life, as then it becomes a second
nature, and cannot afterward be dispensed with. One
accustomed to the luxury of his morning ablution
would feel most uncomfortable if anything prevented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1320'>1320</span>him from taking it; he would as soon think of dispensing
with his breakfast as with his bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every boy, every girl, and every adult ought each
to have either a room or a dressing-room to himself or
to herself, in order that he or she might strip to the
skin and thoroughly wash themselves; no one can
wash properly and effectually without doing so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, for the paraphernalia required for the process:
(1) A large nursery-basin, one that will hold six or
eight quarts of water (Wedgwood’s make being considered
the best); (2) A piece of coarse flannel, a
yard long and half a yard wide; (3) A large sponge;
(4) A tablet either of the best yellow or of curd soap;
(5) Two towels, one being a diaper and the other a
Turkish rubber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, as to the manner of performing ablution. You
ought to fill the basin three parts full with <i>rain</i> water;
then, having well soaped and cleansed your hands, re-soap
them, dip your head and face into the water, then
with the soaped hands well rub and wash your head,
face, neck, chest, and armpits; having done which,
take the wetted sponge, and go over all the parts previously
traveled over by the soaped hands; then fold
the flannel as you would a neckerchief, and dip it in
the water, then throw it, as you would a skipping-rope,
over your shoulders, and move it a few times from
right to left and from left to right, and up and down,
and then across the back and loins; having done which,
dip the sponge in the water, and holding your head
under the water, let the water stream from the sponge
a time or two over your head, neck, and face. Dip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1321'>1321</span>your head and face in the water, then put your hands
and arms (as far as they will go) into the water, holding
them there while you can count thirty. Having
reduced the quantity of water to a third of a basinful,
place the basin on the floor, and sit (while you can
count fifty) <i>in</i> the water; then put one foot at a time
in the water, and quickly rub, with soaped hands, up
and down your leg, over the foot, and pass your thumb
between each toe (this latter procedure tends to keep
away soft corns); then take the sponge, filled with
water, and squeeze it over your leg and foot, from the
knee downward,—then serve your other leg and foot in
the same way. By adopting the above plan, the whole
of the body will, every morning, be thoroughly washed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little warm water might at first, and during the
winter time, be added, to take off the chill; but the
sooner quite cold water is used the better. The body
ought to be quickly dried (taking care to wipe between
each toe), first with the diaper, and then with the
Turkish rubber. In drying your back and loins, you
ought to throw, as you would a skipping-rope, the
Turkish rubber over your shoulders, and move it a few
times from side to side, until the parts be dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the above description is necessarily prolix,
the washing itself ought to be very expeditiously performed;
there should be no dawdling over it, otherwise
the body will become chilled, and harm instead of good
will be the result. If due dispatch be used, the whole
of the body might, according to the above method, be
thoroughly washed and dried in the space of ten
minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1322'>1322</span>A boy ought to wash his head, as above directed,
every morning, a girl, who has much hair, once a week,
with soap and water, with flannel and sponge. The
hair, if not frequently washed, is very dirty, and nothing
is more repulsive than a dirty head!</p>

<p class='c008'>It might be said, “Why do you go into particulars?
why dwell so much upon minutiæ? Every one, without
being told, knows how to wash himself!” I reply,
“That very few people do know how to wash themselves
properly; it is a misfortune they do not—they
would be both much healthier and happier if they did!”</p>

<p class='c008'>303. <i>Have you any remarks to make on boys and
girls learning to swim?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let me strongly urge you to let your sons and
daughters be <i>early</i> taught to swim. Swimming is a
glorious exercise—one of the best that can be taken;
it expands the chest; it promotes digestion; it develops
the muscles, and brings into action some muscles that
in any other form of exercise are but seldom brought
into play; it strengthens and braces the whole frame,
and thus makes the swimmer resist the liability of
catching colds; it gives both boys and girls courage,
energy, and self-reliance,—splendid qualities in this
rough world of ours. Swimming is oftentimes the
means of saving human life; this of itself would be a
great recommendation of its value. It is a delightful
amusement; to breast the waves is as exhilarating to
the spirits as clearing on horseback a five-barred gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>The art of learning to swim is quite as necessary to
be learned by a girl as by a boy; the former has similar
muscles, lungs, and other organs to develop as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1323'>1323</span>latter. It is very desirable that in large towns swimming-baths
for ladies should be instituted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swimming ought, then, to be a part and parcel of the
education of every boy and of every girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swimming does not always agree. This sometimes
arises from a person being quite cold before he plunges
into the water. Many people have an idea that they
ought to go into the water while their bodies are in a
cool state. Now this is a mistaken notion, and is
likely to produce dangerous consequences. The skin
ought to be comfortably warm, neither very hot nor
very cold, and then the bather will receive every advantage
that cold bathing can produce. If he go into
the bath while the body is cold, the blood becomes
chilled, and is driven to internal parts, and thus mischief
is frequently produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>A boy, after using cold bathing, ought, if it <i>agree</i>
with him, to experience a pleasing glow over the whole
surface of his body, his spirits and appetite should be
increased, and he ought to feel stronger; but if it <i>disagree</i>
with him, a chilliness and coldness, a lassitude
and a depression of spirits, will be the result; the face
will be pale and the features will be pinched, and, in
some instances, the lips and the nails will become blue;
all these are signs that <i>cold</i> bathing is injurious, and,
therefore, that it ought on no account to be persevered
in, unless these symptoms have hitherto proceeded
from his going into the bath while he was quite cold.
He may, previously to entering the bath, warm himself
by walking briskly for a few minutes. Where
<i>cold</i> sea water bathing does not agree, <i>warm</i> sea bathing
should be substituted.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1324'>1324</span>304. <i>Which do you prefer—sea bathing or fresh water
bathing?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Sea bathing. Sea bathing is incomparably superior
to fresh water bathing; the salt water is far more refreshing
and invigorating; the battling with the waves
is more exciting; the sea breezes, blowing on the nude
body, breathes (for the skin is a breathing apparatus)
health and strength into the frame, and comeliness into
the face; the sea water and the sea breezes are splendid
cosmetics; the salt water is one of the finest applications,
both for strengthening the roots and brightening
the color of the hair, provided grease and pomatum
have not been previously used.</p>

<p class='c008'>305. <i>Have you any directions to give as to the time
and the seasons, and the best mode of sea bathing?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Summer and autumn are the best seasons of the year
for cold sea bathing—August and September being the
best months. To prepare the skin for the cold sea
bathing, it would be well, before taking a dip in the sea,
to have on the previous day a warm salt-water bath.
It is injurious, and even dangerous, to bathe <i>immediately</i>
after a <i>full</i> meal; the best time to bathe is about
two hours after breakfast—that is to say, at about
eleven or twelve o’clock in the forenoon. The bather,
as soon as he enters the water, <i>ought instantly</i> to wet
his head; this may be done either by his jumping at
once from the machine into the water, or, if he have
not the courage to do so, by plunging his head without
loss of time <i>completely</i> under the water. He should
remain in the water about a quarter of an hour, but
never longer than half an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1325'>1325</span>Many bathers by remaining a long time in the water
do themselves great injury. If sea bathing be found
to be invigorating—and how often to the delicate it
has proved to be truly magical—a patient may bathe
once every day, but on no account oftener. If he be
not strong, he had better, at first, bathe only every
other day, or even only twice a week.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bather, after leaving the machine, ought, for
half an hour, to take a brisk walk in order to promote
a reaction, and thus to cause a free circulation of the
blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>306. <i>Do you think a tepid<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a> bath may be more safely
used?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A tepid bath may be taken at almost any time; and
a bather may remain longer in one, with safety, than
in a cold bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>307. <i>Do you approve of warm bathing?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A warm bath<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c014'><sup>[277]</sup></a> may, with advantage, be occasionally
used—say once a week. A warm bath cleanses the
skin more effectually than either a cold or a tepid bath;
but, as it is more relaxing, ought not to be employed
so often as either of them. A person should not continue
longer than ten minutes in a warm bath. Once
a week, as a rule, is quite often enough for a warm
bath; and it would be an excellent plan if every boy
and girl and adult would make a practice of having
one <i>regularly</i> every week, unless any special reason
should arise to forbid its use.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1326'>1326</span>308. <i>But does not warm bathing, by relaxing the
pores of the skin, cause a person to catch cold if he
expose himself to the air immediately afterward?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is, on this point, a great deal of misconception
and unnecessary fear. A person, <i>immediately</i> after
using a warm bath, should take proper precautions—that
is to say, he must not expose himself to draughts,
neither ought he to wash himself in <i>cold</i> water, nor
should he, <i>immediately</i> after taking one, drink <i>cold</i>
water. But he may follow his usual exercise or employment,
provided the weather be fine, and the wind
be neither in the east nor the northeast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every house of any pretension ought to have a bath-room.
Nothing would be more conducive to health
than regular systematic bathing. A hot and cold
bath, a sitz-bath and a shower-bath—each and all
in their turn—are grand requisites to preserve and
procure health. If the house cannot boast of a bath-room,
then the Corporation baths (which nearly every
large town possesses) ought to be liberally patronized.</p>

<p class='c008'>309. <i>What is the best application for the hair?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A sponge and <i>cold</i> water, and two good hair-brushes.
Avoid grease, pomatum, bandoline, and all abominations
of that kind. There is a natural oil of the hair,
which is far superior to either Rowland’s Macassar oil
or any other oil! The best scent for the hair is an occasional
dressing of soap and water; the best beautifier
of the hair is a downright thorough good brushing
with two good hair-brushes! Again, I say, <i>avoid
grease of all kinds to the hair</i>. “And as for women’s
hair, don’t plaster it with scented and sour grease, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1327'>1327</span>with any grease; it has an oil of its own. And don’t
tie up your hair tight, and make it like a cap of iron
over your skull. And why are your ears covered?
You hear all the worse, and they are not the cleaner.
Besides, the ear is beautiful in itself, and plays its own
part in the concert of the features.”<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>If the hair cannot, without some application, be kept
tidy, then a little of the best sweet oil might, by means
of an old tooth-brush, be used to smooth it; sweet oil
is, for the purpose, one of the most simple and harmless
of dressings; but, as I said before, the hair’s own
natural oil cannot be equaled, far less surpassed!</p>

<p class='c008'>If the hair fall off, castor oil, scented with a few drops
of essence of bergamot and oil of lavender, is a good
remedy to prevent its doing so; a little of it ought,
night and morning, to be well rubbed into the roots of
the hair. Cocoanut oil is another excellent application
for the falling off of the hair.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CLOTHING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>310. <i>Do you approve of a boy wearing flannel next
the skin?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>England is so variable a climate, and the changes
from heat to cold, and from dryness to moisture of the
atmosphere, are so sudden, that some means are required
to guard against their effects. Flannel, as it is
a bad conductor of heat, prevents the sudden changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1328'>1328</span>from affecting the body, and thus is a great preservative
against cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flannel is as necessary in the summer as in the winter
time; indeed, we are more likely both to sit and to
stand in draughts in the summer than in the winter; and
thus we are more liable to become chilled and to catch
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Woolen shirts are now much worn; they are very
comfortable and beneficial to health. Moreover, they
simplify the dress, as they supersede the necessity of
wearing either both flannel and linen, or flannel and
calico shirts.</p>

<p class='c008'>311. <i>Flannel sometimes produces great irritation of
the skin; what ought to be done to prevent it?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Have a moderately fine flannel, and persevere in its
use; the skin in a few days will bear it comfortably.
The Angola and wove-silk waistcoats have been recommended
as substitutes, but there is nothing equal to
the old-fashioned Welsh flannel.</p>

<p class='c008'>312. <i>If a boy have delicate lungs, do you approve
of his wearing a prepared hare-skin over the chest?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do not. The chest may be kept too warm as well
as too cold. The hare-skin heats the chest too much,
and thereby promotes a violent perspiration; which,
by his going into the cold air, may become suddenly
checked, and may thus produce mischief. If the chest
be delicate, there is nothing like flannel to ward off
colds.</p>

<p class='c008'>313. <i>After an attack of Rheumatic Fever, what extra
clothing do you advise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>In the case of a boy, or a girl, just recovering from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1329'>1329</span>a severe attack of rheumatic fever, flannel next the
skin ought always to be worn—flannel drawers as well
as a flannel vest.</p>

<p class='c008'>314. <i>Have you any remarks to make on boys’ waistcoats?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Fashion in this, as in most other instances, is at
direct variance with common sense. It would seem
that fashion was intended to make work for the doctor,
and to swell the bills of mortality! It might be asked,
what part of the chest, in particular, ought to be kept
warm? The upper part needs it most. It is in the
<i>upper</i> part of the lungs that tubercles (consumption)
usually first make their appearance; and is it not preposterous
to have such parts, in particular, kept cool?
Double-breasted waistcoats cannot be too strongly recommended
for <i>delicate</i> youths, and for all men who
have <i>weak</i> chests.</p>

<p class='c008'>315. <i>Have you any directions to give respecting the
shoes and the stockings?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The shoes for winter should be moderately thick and
waterproof. If boys and girls be delicate, they ought
to have double soles to their shoes, with a piece of
bladder between each sole, or the inner sole may be
made of cork; either of the above plans will make the
soles of boots and shoes completely waterproof. In
wet or dirty weather, india-rubber overshoes are useful,
as they keep the <i>upper</i> as well as the <i>under</i> leathers
perfectly dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>The socks or stockings, for winter, ought to be either
lamb’s-wool or worsted; it is absurd to wear <i>cotton</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1330'>1330</span>socks or stockings all the year round. I should advise
a boy to wear socks, not stockings; as he will then be
able to dispense with garters. Garters, as I have remarked
in a previous Conversation, are injurious—they
not only interfere with the circulation of the blood, but
also, by pressure, injure the bones, and thus the shape
of the legs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boys and girls cannot be too particular in keeping
their feet warm and dry, as cold wet feet are one of the
most frequent exciting causes of bronchitis, of sore
throats, and of consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>316. <i>When should a girl begin to wear stays?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>She ought never to wear them.</p>

<p class='c008'>317. <i>Do not stays strengthen the body?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>No; on the contrary, they weaken it. (1) <i>They
weaken the muscles.</i> The pressure upon them causes
them to waste; so that, in the end, a girl cannot do
without them, as the stays are then obliged to perform
the duty of the wasted muscles. (2) <i>They weaken
the lungs</i> by interfering with their functions. Every
inspiration is accompanied by a movement of the ribs.
If this movement be impeded, the functions of the lungs
are impeded likewise; and, consequently, disease is
likely to follow; and either difficulty of breathing, or
cough, or consumption, may ensue. (3) <i>They weaken
the heart’s action</i>, and thus frequently produce palpitation,
and, perhaps, eventually organic or incurable
disease of the heart. (4) <i>They weaken the digestion</i>,
by pushing down the stomach and the liver, and by
compressing the latter; and thus induce indigestion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1331'>1331</span>flatulence, and liver disease.<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c014'><sup>[279]</sup></a> (5) <i>They weaken the
bowels</i>, by impeding their proper peristaltic (spiral)
motion, and thus might produce either constipation or
a rupture. Is it not presumptuous to imagine that
man can improve upon God’s works; and that if more
support had been required the Almighty would not
have given it!</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>318. <i>Have you any remarks to make on female dress?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is a perfect disregard of health in everything
appertaining to fashion. Parts that ought to be kept
warm, remain unclothed: the <i>upper</i> portion of the
chest, most prone to tubercles (consumption), is completely
exposed; the feet, great inlets to cold, are covered
with thin stockings, and with shoes as thin as
paper. Parts that should have full play are cramped
and hampered; the chest is cribbed in with stays, the
feet with <i>tight</i> shoes,—hence causing deformity, and
preventing a free circulation of blood. The mind, that
ought to be calm and unruffled, is kept in a constant
state of excitement by balls, and concerts, and plays.
Mind and body sympathize with each other, and disease
is the consequence. Night is turned into day;
and a delicate girl leaves the heated ball-room, decked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1332'>1332</span>out in her airy finery, to breathe the damp and cold air
of night. She goes to bed, but, for the first few hours,
she is too much excited to sleep; toward morning, when
the air is pure and invigorating, and, when to breathe
it, would be to inhale health and life, she falls into a
feverish slumber, and wakes not until noonday. Oh,
that a mother should be so blinded and so infatuated!</p>

<p class='c008'>319. <i>Have you any observations to make on a girl
wearing a green dress?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is injurious to wear a <i>green</i> dress, if the color have
been imparted to it by means of <i>Scheele’s green</i>, which
is arsenite of copper—a deadly poison. I have known
the arsenic to fly off from a <i>green</i> dress in the form of
powder, and to produce, in consequence, ill health.
Gas-light green is a lovely green, and free from all
danger, and is fortunately superseding the Scheele’s
green both in dresses and in worsted work. I should
advise my fair reader, when she selects green as her
color, always to choose the gas-light green, and to wear
and to use for worsted work no other green besides.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DIET.</h4>

<p class='c018'>320. <i>Which is the most wholesome, coffee or tea,
where milk does not agree, for a youth’s breakfast?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Coffee, provided it be made properly, and provided
the boy or the girl take a great deal of out-door exercise;
if a youth be much confined within doors, black
tea is preferable to coffee. The usual practice of making
coffee is to boil it, to get out the strength! But the
fact is, the process of boiling boils the strength away;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1333'>1333</span>it drives off that aromatic, grateful principle, so wholesome
to the stomach, and so exhilarating to the spirits;
and, in lieu of which, extracts its dregs and impurities,
which are both heavy and difficult of digestion. The
coffee ought, if practicable, to be <i>freshly</i> ground every
morning, in order that you may be quite sure that it be
perfectly genuine, and that none of the aroma of the
coffee has flown off from long exposure to the atmosphere.
If a youth’s bowels be inclined to be costive,
coffee is preferable to tea for breakfast, as coffee tends
to keep the bowels regular. Fresh milk ought always
to be added to the coffee in the proportion of half coffee
and half new milk. If coffee does not agree, then <i>black</i>
tea should be substituted, which ought to be taken with
plenty of fresh milk in it. Milk may be frequently
given in tea, when it otherwise would disagree.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a youth be delicate, it is an excellent plan to
give him every morning before he leaves his bed, a
tumblerful of <i>new</i> milk. The draught of milk, of
course, is not in any way to interfere with his regular
breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>321. <i>Do you approve of a boy eating meat with his
breakfast?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This will depend upon the exercise he uses. If he
have had a good walk or run before breakfast, or if he
intend, after breakfast, to take plenty of athletic out-door
exercise, meat, or a rasher or two of bacon, may,
with advantage be eaten, but not otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>322. <i>What is the best dinner for a youth?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Fresh mutton or beef, a variety of vegetables, and a
farinaceous pudding. It is a bad practice to allow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1334'>1334</span>him to dine exclusively, either on a fruit-pudding or
on any other pudding, or on pastry. Unless he be ill,
he must, if he is to be healthy, strong, and courageous,
eat meat every day of his life. “All courageous animals
are carnivorous, and greater courage is to be expected
in a people, such as the English, whose food is
strong and hearty, than in the half-starved commonalty
of other countries.”<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c014'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Let him be debarred from rich soups and from high-seasoned
dishes, which only disorder the stomach and
inflame the blood. It is a mistake to give a boy or
girl broth or soup, in lieu of meat for dinner; the stomach
takes such slops in a grumbling way, and is not
at all satisfied. It may be well, occasionally, to give
a youth with his dinner, <i>in addition to his meat</i>, either
good soup or good broth, not highly-seasoned, made
of good <i>meat</i> stock. But after all that can be said on
the subject, a plain joint of meat, either roast or boiled,
is far superior for health and strength than either soup
or broth, let it be ever so good or so well made.</p>

<p class='c008'>He should be desired to take plenty of time over his
dinner, so that he may be able to chew his food well,
and thus that it may be reduced to an impalpable mass,
and be well mixed with the saliva,—which the action
of the jaws will cause to be secreted—before it passes
into the stomach. If such were usually the case, the
stomach would not have double duty to perform, and
a boy would not so frequently lay the foundation of
indigestion, etc., which may embitter and even make
miserable his after-life.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1335'>1335</span>Meat, plain pudding, vegetables, bread, and hunger
for sauce (which exercise will readily give), is the best,
and, indeed, should be as a rule, the only dinner he
should have. A youth ought not to dine later than
two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>323. <i>Do you consider broths and soups wholesome?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The stomach can digest solid much more readily
than it can liquid food; on which account the dinner
specified above is far preferable to one either of broth
or of soup. Fluids in large quantities too much dilute
the gastric juice and overdistend the stomach, and
hence weaken it, and thus produce indigestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>324. <i>Do you approve of a boy drinking beer with
his dinner?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is no objection to a little good, mild table-beer,
but <i>strong</i> ale ought never to be allowed. It is,
indeed, questionable, whether a boy, unless he takes
unusual exercise, requires anything but water with his
meals.</p>

<p class='c008'>325. <i>Do you approve of a youth, more especially if
he be weakly, having a glass or two of wine after dinner?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I disapprove of it. His young blood does not require
to be inflamed and his sensitive nerves excited
with wine; and if he be delicate, I should be sorry to
endeavor to strengthen him by giving him such an inflammable
fluid. If he be weakly, he is more predisposed
to put on either fever or inflammation of some
organ; and, being thus predisposed, wine would be
likely to excite either the one or the other of them into
action. A parent ought on no account to allow a boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1336'>1336</span>to touch spirits, however much diluted; they are to
the young still more deadly in their effects than wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>326. <i>Have you any objection to a youth drinking tea?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Not at all, provided it be not green tea, that it be
not made strong, and that it have plenty of milk in it.
Green tea is apt to make people nervous, and boys and
girls ought not even to know what it is to be nervous.</p>

<p class='c008'>327. <i>Do you object to supper for a youth?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Meat suppers are highly prejudicial. If he be hungry
(and if he have been much in the open air, he is almost
sure to be), a piece of bread and cheese, or of bread
and butter, with a draught either of new milk or of
table-beer, will form the best supper he can have. He
ought not to sup later than eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>328. <i>Do you approve of a boy having anything between
meals?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do not; let him have four meals a day, and he will
require nothing in the intervals. It is a mistaken notion
that “little and often is best.” The stomach requires
rest as much as, or perhaps more than (for it is
frequently sadly overworked) any other part of the
body. I do not mean that he is to have “<i>much</i> and
seldom:” moderation, in everything, is to be observed.
Give him as much as a growing boy requires (<i>and that
is a great deal</i>), but do not let him eat gluttonously, as
many indulgent parents encourage their children to do.
Intemperance in eating cannot be too strongly condemned.</p>

<p class='c008'>329. <i>Have you any objection to a boy having pocket
money?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is a bad practice to allow a boy <i>much</i> pocket
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1337'>1337</span>money; if he be so allowed, he will be loading his
stomach with sweets, fruit, and pastry, and thus his
stomach will become cloyed and disordered, and the
keen appetite, so characteristic of youth, will be blunted,
and ill health will ensue. “In a public education, boys
early learn temperance, and if the parents and friends
would give them less money upon their usual visits, it
would be much to their advantage, since it may justly
be said that a great part of their disorders arise from
surfeit, ‘<i><span lang="la">plus occidit gula quam gladius</span></i>’ (gluttony kills
more than the sword).”<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>How true is the saying that “many people dig their
graves with their teeth.” You may depend upon it
that more die from stuffing than from starvation!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>AIR AND EXERCISE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>330. <i>Have you any remarks to make on fresh air
and exercise for boys and girls?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Girls and boys, especially the former, are too much
confined within doors. It is imperatively necessary, if
you wish them to be strong and healthy, that they
should have plenty of fresh air and exercise; remember,
I mean fresh air—country air, not the close air of a
town. By exercise, I mean the free unrestrained use
of their limbs. Girls, in this respect, are unfortunately
worse off than boys, although they have similar muscles
to develop, similar lungs that require fresh air, and
similar nerves to be braced and strengthened. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1338'>1338</span>not considered ladylike to be natural—all their movements
must be measured by rule and compass!</p>

<p class='c008'>The reason why so many young girls of the present
day are so sallow, undersized, and ill shaped, is for the
want of air and exercise. After a time the want of air
and exercise, by causing ill health, makes them slothful
and indolent—it is a trouble for them to move from
their chairs!</p>

<p class='c008'>Respiration, digestion, and a proper action of the
bowels imperatively demand fresh air and exercise.
Ill health will inevitably ensue if boys and girls are
cooped up a great part of the day in a close room. A
distinguished writer of the present day says: “The
children of the very poor are always out and about.
In this respect they are an example to those careful
mammas who keep their children, the whole day long,
in their chairs, reading, writing, ciphering, drawing,
practicing music lessons, doing crochet work, or anything,
in fact, except running about, in spite of the sunshine
always peeping in and inviting them out of doors;
and who, in the due course of time, are surprised to
find their children growing up with incurable heart,
head, lung, or stomach complaints.”</p>

<p class='c008'>331. <i>What is the best exercise for youth?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Walking or running, provided it be not carried to
fatigue. The slightest approach to it should warn a
youth to desist from carrying it further.</p>

<p class='c008'>Walking exercise is not sufficiently insisted upon. A
boy or a girl, to be in the enjoyment of good health,
ought to walk at least ten miles every day. I do not
mean ten miles at a stretch, but at different times of
the day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1339'>1339</span>Some young ladies think it an awfully long walk if
they manage a couple of miles! How can they, with
such exercise, expect to be well? How can their muscles
be developed? How can their nerves be braced?
How can their spines be strengthened and be straight?
How can their blood course merrily through their
blood-vessels? How can their chests expand and be
strong? Why, it is impossible! Ill health must be
the penalty of such indolence, for Nature will not be
trifled with!</p>

<p class='c008'>Walking exercise, then, is the finest exercise that can
be taken, and must be taken, and that without stint, if
boys and girls are to be strong and well!</p>

<p class='c008'>The advantage of our climate is, that there is not a
day in the whole year that walking exercise cannot be
enjoyed. I use the term <i>enjoyed</i> advisedly. The roads
may of course be dirty; but what of that? A good,
thick pair of boots will be the remedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do then, let me entreat you, insist upon your girls
and boys taking plenty of exercise; let them almost
live in the open air! Do not coddle them; this is a
rough world of ours, and they must rough it; they
must be knocked about a little, and the knocks will do
them good. Poor youths who are, as it were, tied to
their mothers’ apron-strings, are much to be pitied;
they are usually puny and delicate, and utterly deficient
of self-reliance.</p>

<p class='c008'>332. <i>Do you approve of horse or pony exercise for
boys and girls?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Most certainly I do; but still it ought not to supersede
walking. Horse or pony exercise is very beneficial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1340'>1340</span>and cannot be too strongly recommended. One
great advantage for those living in towns, which it has
over walking, is that a person may go farther into the
country, and thus be enabled to breathe a purer and
more healthy atmosphere. Again, it is a much more
<i>amusing</i> exercise than walking, and this, for the young,
is a great consideration indeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Horse exercise is for both boys and girls a splendid
exercise; it improves the figure, it gives grace to the
movements, it strengthens the chest, it braces the muscles,
and gives to the character energy and courage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both boys and girls ought to be early taught to ride.
There is nothing that gives more pleasure to the young
than riding either on a pony or on a horse, and for
younger children, even on that despised, although useful
animal, a donkey. Exercise, taken with pleasure,
is doubly beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>If girls were to ride more on horseback than they
now do, we should hear less of crooked spines and of
round shoulders, of chlorosis and of hysteria, and of
other numerous diseases of that class, owing, generally,
to debility and to mismanagement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those ladies who “affect the saddle” are usually
much healthier, stronger, and straighter than those
who either never or but seldom ride on horseback.</p>

<p class='c008'>Riding on horseback is both an exercise and an
amusement, and is peculiarly suitable for the fair sex,
more especially as their modes of exercise are somewhat
limited, ladies being excluded from following
many games, such as cricket and football, both of which
are practiced, with such zest and benefit, by the rougher
sex.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1341'>1341</span>333. <i>Do you approve of carriage exercise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>There is no muscular exertion in carriage exercise;
its principal advantage is, that it enables a person to
have a change of air, which may be purer than the one
he is in the habit of breathing. But, whether it be so
or not, change of air frequently does good, even if the
air be not so pure. Carriage exercise, therefore, does
only partial good, and ought never to supersede either
walking or horse exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>334. <i>What is the best time of the day for the taking
of exercise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>In the summer time, early in the morning and before
breakfast, as “cool morning air exhilarates young blood
like wine.” If a boy cannot take exercise upon an
empty stomach, let him have a slice of bread and a
draught of milk. When he returns home, he will be
able to do justice to his breakfast. In fine weather he
cannot take too much exercise, provided it be not
carried to fatigue.</p>

<p class='c008'>335. <i>What is the best time for him to keep quiet?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He ought not to take exercise immediately after—say
for half an hour after—a hearty meal, or it will be
likely to interfere with his digestion.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>AMUSEMENTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>336. <i>What amusements do you recommend for a
boy as being most beneficial to health?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Many games—such as rowing, skating, cricket,
quoits, football, rackets, single-stick, bandy, bowls,
skittles, and all gymnastic exercises. Such games
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1342'>1342</span>bring the muscles into proper action, and thus cause
them to be fully developed. They expand and
strengthen the chest; they cause a due circulation of
the blood, making it to bound merrily through the
blood-vessels, and thus to diffuse health and happiness
in its course. Another excellent amusement for boys
is the brandishing of clubs. They ought to be made
in the form of a constable’s staff, but should be much
larger and heavier. The manner of handling them is
so graphically described by Addison that I cannot do
better than transcribe it: “When I was some years
younger than I am at present, I used to employ myself
in a more laborious diversion, which I learned
from a Latin treatise of exercises that is written with
great erudition; it is there called the <span lang="grc">σκιομαχια</span>, or the
fighting with a man’s own shadow, and consists in the
brandishing of two short sticks grasped in each hand,
and loaded with plugs of lead at either end. This
opens the chest, exercises the limbs, and gives a man
all the pleasure of boxing without the blows. I could
wish that several learned men would lay out that time
which they employ in controversies and disputes about
nothing, in this method of fighting with their own
shadows. It might conduce very much to evaporate
the spleen which makes them uneasy to the public as
well as to themselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another capital healthful game is single-stick, which
makes a boy “to gain an upright and elastic carriage,
and to learn the use of his limbs.”<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Single-stick may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1343'>1343</span>be taught by any drill-sergeant in the neighborhood.
Do everything to make a boy strong. Remember,
“the glory of young men is their strength.”<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c014'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>If games were more patronized in youth, so many
miserable, nervous, useless creatures would not abound.
Let a boy or a girl, then, have plenty of play; let half
of his or her time be spent in play.</p>

<p class='c008'>There ought to be a gymnasium established in every
town of the kingdom. The gymnasium, the cricket
ground, and the swimming bath are among our finest
institutions, and should be patronized accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>First of all, by an abundance of exercise and of fresh
air make your boys and girls strong, and then, in due
time, they will be ready and be able to have their minds
properly cultivated. Unfortunately, in this enlightened
age, we commence at the wrong end—we put the cart
before the horse—we begin by cultivating the mind,
and we leave the body to be taken care of afterward;
the results are, broken health, precocious, stunted,
crooked, and deformed youths, and premature decay.</p>

<p class='c008'>One great advantage of gymnastic exercise is, it
makes the lungs expand, it fills the lungs with air, and
by doing so, strengthens the lungs amazingly and
wards off many diseases. The lungs are not sufficiently
exercised and expanded; boys and girls, girls especially,
do not as a rule half fill their lungs with air! now, air
to the lungs is food to the lungs, and portions of the
lungs have not half their proper food, and in consequence
suffer.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1344'>1344</span>It is very desirable that every boy and girl should,
every day of his or her life, and for a quarter of an
hour at least each time, go through a regular <i>breathing
exercise</i>—that is to say, should be made to stand upright,
throw back the shoulders, and the while, alternately
and regularly, fully fill and fully empty the
lungs of air. If this plan were daily followed, the
chest and lungs would be wonderfully invigorated, and
the whole body benefited.</p>

<p class='c008'>337. <i>Is playing the flute, blowing the bugle, or any
other wind instrument, injurious to health?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Decidedly so; the lungs and the windpipe are brought
into unnatural action by them. If a boy be of a consumptive
habit, this will, of course, hold good with
tenfold force. If a youth must be musical, let him be
taught singing, as that, provided the lungs be not diseased,
will be beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>338. <i>What amusements do you recommend for a
girl?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Archery, skipping, horse exercise, croquet, the hand-swing,
the fly-pole, skating, and dancing are among
the best. Archery expands the chest, throws back the
shoulders, thus improving the figure, and develops the
muscles. Skipping is exceedingly good exercise for a
girl, every part of the body being put into action by it.
Horse exercise is splendid for a girl; it improves the
figure amazingly—it is most exhilarating and amusing;
moreover, it gives her courage and makes her self-reliant.
Croquet develops and improves the muscles
of the arms, beautifies the complexion, strengthens the
back, and throws out the chest. Croquet is for girls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1345'>1345</span>and women what cricket is for boys and men—a glorious
game. Croquet has improved both the health
and the happiness of womankind more than any game
ever before invented. Croquet, in the bright sunshine,
with the winds of heaven blowing about the players,
is not like a ball in a stifling hot ball-room, with gas-lights
poisoning the air. Croquet is a more sensible
amusement than dancing; it brings the intellect as well
as the muscles into play. The man who invented croquet
has deserved greater glory, and has done more
good to his species, than many philosophers whose
names are emblazoned in story. Hand-swing is a
capital exercise for a girl; the whole of the body is
thrown into action by it, and the spine, the shoulders,
and the shoulder-blades are especially benefited. The
fly-pole, too, is good exercise for the whole of the muscles
of the body, especially of the legs and the arms.
Skating is as exhilarating as a glass of champagne, but
will do her far more good! Skating exhilarates the
spirits, improves the figure, and makes a girl balance
and carry herself well; it is a most becoming exercise
for her, and is much in every way to be commended.
Moreover, skating gives a girl courage and self-reliance
Dancing, followed as a rational amusement, causes a
free circulation of the blood, and, provided it does not
induce her to sit up late at night, is most beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>339. <i>If dancing be so beneficial, why are balls such
fruitful sources of coughs, of colds, and consumptions?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>On many accounts. They induce young ladies to
sit up late at night; they cause them to dress more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1346'>1346</span>lightly than they are accustomed to do; and thus thinly
clad, they leave their homes while the weather is perhaps
piercing cold, to plunge into a suffocating, hot
ball-room, made doubly injurious by the immense number
of lights, which consume the oxygen intended for
the due performance of the healthy function of the
lungs. Their partners, the brilliancy of the scene, and
the music excite their nerves to undue, and thus to
unnatural action, and what is the consequence? Fatigue,
weakness, hysterics, and extreme depression
follow. They leave the heated ball-room, when the
morning has far advanced, to breathe the bitterly cold
and frequently damp air of a winter’s night, and what
is the result? Hundreds die of consumption who might
otherwise have lived. Ought there not, then, to be a
distinction between a ball at midnight and a dance in
the evening?</p>

<p class='c008'>340. <i>But still, would you have a girl brought up to
forego the pleasures of a ball?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If a parent prefer her so-called pleasures to her
health, certainly not; to such a mother I do not address
myself.</p>

<p class='c008'>341. <i>Have you any remarks to make on singing, or
on reading aloud?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Before a mother allows her daughter to take lessons
in singing, she should ascertain that there be no actual
disease of the lungs, for if there be, it will probably
excite it into action; but if no disease exist, singing
or reading aloud is very conducive to health. Public
singers are seldom known to die of consumption.
Singing expands the chest, improves the pronunciation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1347'>1347</span>enriches the voice for conversation, strengthens the
lungs, and wards off many of their diseases.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EDUCATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>342. <i>Do you approve of corporal punishment in
schools?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I do not. I consider it to be decidedly injurious
both to body and mind. Is it not painful to witness
the pale cheeks and the dejected looks of those boys
who are often flogged? If their tempers are mild, their
spirits are broken; if their dispositions are at all obstinate,
they become hardened and willful, and are
made little better than brutes.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c014'><sup>[285]</sup></a> A boy who is often
flogged loses that noble ingenuousness and fine sensibility
so characteristic of youth. He looks upon his
school as his prison, and his master as his jailer, and,
as he grows up to manhood, hates and despises the
man who has flogged him. Corporal punishment is
revolting, disgusting, and demoralizing to the boy, and
is degrading to the school-master as a man and as a
Christian.</p>

<p class='c008'>If school-masters must flog, let them flog their own
sons. If they must ruin the tempers, the dispositions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1348'>1348</span>and the constitutions of boys, they have more right to
practice upon their own than on other people’s children!
Oh that parents would raise—and that without
any uncertain sound—their voices against such
abominations, and the detestable cane would soon be
banished the school-room! “I am confident that no
boy,” says Addison, “who will not be allured by letters
without blows, will never be brought to anything
with them. A great or good mind must necessarily be
the worse for such indignities; and it is a sad change
to lose of its virtue for the improvement of its knowledge.
No one has gone through what they call a
great school, but must have remembered to have seen
children of excellent and ingenuous natures (as have
afterward appeared in their manhood). I say, no man
has passed through this way of education but must
have seen an ingenuous creature expiring with shame,
with pale looks, beseeching sorrow, and silent tears,
throw up its honest eyes, and kneel on its tender
knees to an inexorable blockhead, to be forgiven the
false quantity of a word in making a Latin verse.
The child is punished, and the next day he commits a
like crime, and so a third, with the same consequence.
I would fain ask any reasonable man whether this
lad, in the simplicity of his native innocence, full
of shame, and capable of any impression from that
grace of soul, was not fitter for any purpose in this life
than after that spark of virtue is extinguished in him,
though he is able to write twenty verses in an evening?”</p>

<p class='c008'>How often is corporal punishment resorted to at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1349'>1349</span>school because the master is in a passion, and he vents
his rage upon the poor school-boy’s unfortunate back!</p>

<p class='c008'>Oh! the mistaken notion that flogging will make a
bad-behaved boy a good boy; it has the contrary
effect. “‘I dunno how ’tis, sir,’ said an old farm-laborer,
in reply to a question from his clergyman
respecting the bad behavior of his children, ‘I dunno
how ’tis; I beats ’em till they’re black and blue, and
when they won’t kneel down to pray I knocks ’em
down, and yet they ain’t good.’”<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c014'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In an excellent article in <cite>Temple Bar</cite> (November,
1864) on flogging in the army, the following sensible
remarks occur: “In nearly a quarter of a century’s
experience with soldiers, the writer has always, and
without a single exception, found flogging makes a
good man bad, and a bad man worse.” With equal
truth it may be said that, without a single exception,
flogging makes a good boy bad, and a bad boy worse.
How many men owe their ferocity to the canings they
received when school-boys! The early floggings hardened
and soured them, and blunted their sensibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Arnold of Rugby, one of the best school-masters
that England ever produced, seldom caned a boy—not
more than once or twice during the half year; but
when he did cane him, he charged for the use of the
cane each time in the bill, in order that the parents
might know how many times their son had been
punished. At some of our public schools nowadays
a boy is caned as many times in a morning as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1350'>1350</span>worthy doctor would have caned him during the whole
half year; but then the doctor treated the boys as gentlemen,
and trusted much to their honor; but now
many school-masters trust much to fear, little to honor,
and treat them as brute beasts.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might be said that the discipline of a school cannot
be maintained unless the boys be frequently caned—that
it must be either caning or expulsion. I deny
these assertions. Dr. Arnold was able to conduct his
school with honor to himself, and with immense
benefit to the rising generation, without either frequent
canings or expulsions. The humane plan, however,
requires at first both trouble and patience; and trouble
some school-masters do not like, and patience they do
not possess; the use of the cane is quick, sharp, and
at the time effective.</p>

<p class='c008'>If caning be ever necessary, which it might occasionally
be, for the telling of lies for instance, or for
gross immorality, let the head master himself be the
only one to perform the operation, but let him not be
allowed to delegate it to others. A law ought in all
public schools to be in force to that effect. High time
that something was done to abate such disgraceful
practices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never should a school-master, or any one else, be
allowed, <i>on any pretense whatever</i>, to strike a boy upon
his head. Boxing of the ears has sometimes caused
laceration of the drum of the ear, and consequent
partial deafness for life. Boxing of the ears injures
the brain, and therefore the intellect.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might be said that I am traveling out of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1351'>1351</span>province in making remarks on corporal chastisement
in schools. But, with deference, I reply that I am
strictly in the path of duty. My office is to inform you
of everything that is detrimental to your children’s
health and happiness; and corporal punishment is
assuredly most injurious both to their health and happiness.
It is the bounden duty of every man, and
especially of every medical man, to lift up his voice
against the abominable, disgusting, and degrading system
of flogging, and to warn parents of the danger and
the mischief of sending boys to those schools where
flogging is permitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>343. <i>Have you any observations to make on the
selection of a female boarding-school?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Home education, where it be practicable, is far preferable
to sending a girl to school; as <i>at</i> home, her health,
her morals, and her household duties can be attended
to much more effectually than <i>from</i> home. Moreover,
it is a serious injury to a girl, in more ways than one,
to separate her from her own brothers; they very much
lose their affection for each other, and mutual companionship
(so delightful and beneficial between brothers
and sisters) is severed.</p>

<p class='c008'>If home education be not practicable, great care
must be taken in making choice of a school. Boarding-school
education requires great reformation. Accomplishments,
superficial acquirements, and brainwork
are the order of the day; health is very little studied.
You ought, in the education of your daughters, to
remember that they, in a few years, will be the wives
and the mothers of England; and if they have not health
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1352'>1352</span>and strength, and a proper knowledge of household
duties to sustain their characters, what useless, listless
wires and mothers they will make!</p>

<p class='c008'>Remember, then, the body and not the mind ought
in early life to be principally cultivated and strengthened,
and that the growing brain will not bear, with
impunity, much book learning. The brain of a schoolgirl
is frequently injured by getting up voluminous
questions by rote, that are not of the slightest use or
benefit to her or to any one else. Instead of this ridiculous
system, educate a girl to be useful and self-reliant.
“From babyhood they are given to understand
that helplessness is feminine and beautiful;
helpfulness, except in certain received forms of manifestation,
unwomanly and ugly. The boys may do
a thousand things which are ‘not proper for little
girls.’”<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c014'><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>From her twelfth to her seventeenth year is the
most important epoch of a girl’s existence, as regards
her future health, and consequently, in a great measure,
her future happiness; and one in which, more than at
any other period of her life, she requires a plentiful
supply of fresh air, exercise, recreation, a variety of
innocent amusements, and an abundance of good nourishment,
more especially fresh meat; if therefore you
have determined on sending your girl to school, you
must ascertain that the pupils have as much plain,
wholesome, nourishing food as they can eat,<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c014'><sup>[288]</sup></a> that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1353'>1353</span>school be situated in a healthy spot, that it be well
drained, that there be a large play-ground attached to
it, that the young people are allowed plenty of exercise
in the open air—indeed, that at least one-third of the
day is spent there in croquet, skipping, archery, battledore
and shuttlecock, gardening, walking, running, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take care that the school-rooms are well ventilated,
that they are not overcrowded, and that the pupils are
allowed chairs to sit upon, and not those abominations—forms
and stools. If you wish to try the effect of
them upon yourself, sit for a couple of hours without
stirring upon a form or upon a stool, and take my word
for it you will insist that forms and stools be banished
forever from the school-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Assure yourself that the pupils are compelled to rise
early in the morning, and that they retire early to rest:
that each young lady has a separate bed,<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c014'><sup>[289]</sup></a> and that
many are not allowed to sleep in the same room, and
that the apartments are large and well ventilated. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1354'>1354</span>fine, their health and their morals ought to be preferred
far above all their accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c008'>344. <i>They use, in some schools, straight-backed
chairs, to make a girl sit upright and to give strength
to her back: do you approve of them?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Certainly not. The natural and the graceful curve
of the back is not the curve of a straight-backed chair.
Straight-backed chairs are instruments of torture, and
are more likely to make a girl crooked than to make
her straight. Sir Astley Cooper ridiculed straight-backed
chairs, and well he might. It is always well
for a mother to try, for some considerable time, such
ridiculous inventions upon herself before she experiments
upon her unfortunate daughter. The position
is most unnatural. I do not approve of a girl lounging
and lolling on a sofa; but, if she be tired and wants to
rest herself, let her, like any other reasonable being,
sit upon a comfortable ordinary chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you want her to be straight, let her be made
strong; and if she is to be strong, she must use plenty
of exercise and exertion, such as drilling, dancing, skipping,
archery, croquet, hand-swinging, horse exercise,
swimming, bowls, etc. This is the plan to make her
back straight and her muscles strong. Why should
we bring up a girl differently from a boy? Muscular
gymnastic exercises and health-giving exertion are unladylike,
forsooth!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1355'>1355</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>HOUSEHOLD WORK FOR GIRLS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>345. <i>Do you recommend household work as a means
of health for my daughter?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Decidedly. Whatever you do, do not make a fine
lady of her, or she will become puny and delicate, listless
and miserable. A girl, let her station be what it
might, ought, as soon as she be old enough, to make
her own bed. There is no exercise to expand the figure
and to beautify the shape better than bed-making. Let
her make tidy her own room. Let her use her hands
and her arms. Let her, to a great extent, be self-reliant,
and let her wait upon herself. There is nothing vulgar
in her being useful. Let me ask, Of what use are many
girls of the present day? They are utterly useless.
Are they happy? No, for the want of employment
they are miserable—I mean, bodily employment, household
work. Many girls, nowadays, unfortunately, are
made to look upon a pretty face, dress, and accomplishments
as the only things needed! And, when they do
become women and wives—if ever they do become
women and wives—what miserable, lackadaisical wives,
and what senseless, useless mothers they make!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CHOICE OF PROFESSION OR TRADE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>346. <i>What profession or trade would you recommend
a boy of a delicate or of a consumptive habit to follow?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If a youth be delicate, it is a common practice among
parents either to put him to some light in-door trade,
or, if they can afford it, to one of the learned professions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1356'>1356</span>Such a practice is absurd, and fraught with danger
The close confinement of an in-door trade is highly prejudicial
to health. The hard reading requisite to fit a
man to fill, for instance, the sacred office, only increases
delicacy of constitution. The stooping at a desk, in an
attorney’s office, is most trying to the chest. The
harass, the anxiety, the disturbed nights, the interrupted
meals, and the intense study necessary to fit a man for
the medical profession, is still more dangerous to health
than either law, divinity, or any in-door trade. “Sir
Walter Scott says of the country surgeon, that he is
worse fed and harder wrought than any one else in the
parish, except it be his horse.”<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>A modern writer, speaking of the life of a medical
man, observes: “There is no career which so rapidly
wears away the powers of life, because there is no other
which requires a greater activity of mind and body. He
has to bear the changes of weather, continued fatigue,
irregularity in his meals, and broken rest; to live in the
midst of miasma and contagion. If in the country, he
has to traverse considerable distances on horseback,
exposed to wind and storm—to brave all dangers to go
to the relief of suffering humanity. A fearful truth for
medical men has been established by the table of mortality
by Dr. Casper, published in the <cite>British Review</cite>.
Of 1000 members of the medical profession, 600 died
before their sixty-second year; while of persons leading
a quiet life—such as agriculturists or theologians—the
mortality is only 347. If we take 100 individuals of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1357'>1357</span>each of these classes, 43 theologians, 40 agriculturists,
35 clerks, 32 soldiers, will reach their seventieth year:
of 100 professors of the healing art, 24 only will reach
that age. They are the sign-posts to health; they can
show the road to old age, but rarely tread it themselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If a boy, therefore, be of a delicate or of a consumptive
habit, an out-door calling should be advised, such
as that of a farmer, of a tanner, or a land-surveyor;
but, if he be of an inferior station of society, the trade
of a butcher may be recommended. Tanners and
butchers are seldom known to die of consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>I cannot refrain from reprobating the too common
practice among parents of bringing up their boys to the
professions. The anxieties and the heartaches which
they undergo if they do not succeed (and how can
many of them succeed when there is such a superabundance
of candidates?) materially injure their
health. “I very much wonder,” says Addison, “at
the humor of parents, who will not rather choose to
place their sons in a way of life where an honest industry
cannot but thrive, than in stations where the greatest
probity, learning, and good sense may miscarry.
How many men are country curates, that might have
made themselves aldermen of London by a right improvement
of a smaller sum of money than what is
usually laid out upon a learned education? A sober,
frugal person, of slender parts and a slow apprehension,
might have thrived in trade, though he starves
upon physic; as a man would be well enough pleased
to buy silks of one whom he could not venture to feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1358'>1358</span>his pulse. Vagellius is careful, studious, and obliging,
but withal a little thick-skulled; he has not a single
client, but might have had abundance of customers.
The misfortune is, that parents take a liking to a particular
profession, and therefore desire their sons may
be of it; whereas, in so great an affair of life, they
should consider the genius and abilities of their children
more than their own inclinations. It is the great advantage
of a trading nation, that there are very few in
it so dull and heavy who may not be placed in stations
of life which may give them an opportunity of making
their fortunes. A well-regulated commerce is not, like
law, physic, or divinity, to be overstocked with hands;
but, on the contrary, flourishes by multitudes, and gives
employment to all its professors. Fleets of merchantmen
are so many squadrons of floating shops, that vend
our wares and manufactures in all the markets of the
world, and find out chapmen under both the tropics.”</p>

<p class='c008'>347. <i>Then, do you recommend a delicate youth to
be brought up either to a profession or to a trade?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Decidedly. There is nothing so injurious for a delicate
boy, or for any one else, as idleness. Work, in
moderation, enlivens the spirits, braces the nerves, and
gives tone to the muscles, and thus strengthens the
constitution. Of all miserable people, the idle boy or
the idle man is the most miserable! If you are poor,
of course you will bring him up to some calling; but
if you are rich, and your boy is delicate (if he be not
actually in a consumption), you will, if you are wise,
still bring him up to some trade or profession. You
will, otherwise, be making a rod for your own as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1359'>1359</span>as for your son’s back. Oh, what a blessed thing is
work!</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SLEEP.</h4>

<p class='c018'>348. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the sleep of
boys and girls?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Sleeping-rooms are, generally, the smallest in the
house, whereas, for health’s sake, they ought to be the
largest. If it be impossible to have a <i>large</i> bedroom,
I should advise a parent to have a dozen or twenty
holes (each about the size of a florin) bored with a
center-bit in the upper part of the chamber-door, and
the same number of holes in the lower part of the door,
so as constantly to admit a free current of air from the
passages. If this cannot readily be done, then let the
bedroom door be left ajar all night, a door-chain being
on the door to prevent intrusion; and, in the summer
time, during the night, let the window-sash, to the extent
of about two or three inches, be left open.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there be a dressing-room next to the bedroom, it
will be well to have the dressing-room window, instead
of the bedroom window, open at night. The dressing-room
door will regulate the quantity of air to be admitted
into the bedroom, opening it either little or
much, as the weather might be cold or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Fresh air during sleep is indispensable to health.</i>—If
a bedroom be close, the sleep, instead of being
calm and refreshing, is broken and disturbed; and the
boy, when he awakes in the morning, feels more fatigued
than when he retired to rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>If sleep is to be refreshing, the air, then, must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1360'>1360</span>pure, and free from carbonic acid gas, which is constantly
being evolved from the lungs. If sleep is to be
health-giving, the lungs ought to have their proper food,
oxygen,—and not be cheated by giving them instead
a poison, carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be well for each boy to have a separate
room to himself, and each girl a separate room to herself.
If two boys are obliged, from the smallness of
the house, to sleep in one room, and if two girls, from
the same cause, are compelled to occupy the same
chamber, by all means let each one have a <i>separate</i> bed
to himself and to herself, as it is so much more healthy
and expedient for both boys and girls to sleep alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roof of the bed should be left open—that is to
say, the top of the bedstead ought not be covered with
bed furniture, but should be open to the ceiling, in order
to encourage a free ventilation of air. A bed-curtain
may be allowed on the side of the bed where there are
windy currents of air; otherwise bed-curtains and
valances ought on no account to be allowed. They
prevent a free circulation of the air. A youth should
sleep on a horse-hair mattress. Such mattresses greatly
improve the figure and strengthen the frame. During
the daytime, provided it does not rain, the windows
must be thrown wide open, and, directly after he has
risen from bed, the clothes ought to be thrown entirely
back, in order that they may become, before the bed be
made, well ventilated and purified by the air:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Plants and flowers ought not to be allowed to remain
in a chamber at night. Experiments have proved that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1362'>1362</span>plants and flowers take up, in the daytime, carbonic
acid gas (the refuse of respiration), and give off oxygen
(a gas so necessary and beneficial to health), but give
out in the night season a poisonous exhalation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early rising cannot be too strongly insisted upon;
nothing is more conducive to health, and thus to long
life. A youth is frequently allowed to spend the early
part of the morning in bed, breathing the impure
atmosphere of a bedroom, when he should be up and
about, inhaling the balmy and health-giving breezes
of the morning:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If early rising be commenced in childhood it becomes
a habit, and will then probably be continued through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1363'>1363</span>life. A boy ought on no account to be roused from his
sleep; but as soon as he be awake in the morning, he
should be encouraged to rise. Dozing—that state
between sleeping and waking—is injurious; it enervates
both body and mind, and is as detrimental to
health as dram-drinking! But if he rise early, he must
go to bed betimes; it is a bad practice to keep him up
until the family retire to rest. He ought, winter and
summer, to seek his pillow by nine o’clock, and should
rise as soon as he awakes in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me urge upon a parent the great importance of
<i>not</i> allowing the chimney of any bedroom, or of any
room in the house, to be stopped, as many are in the
habit of doing, to prevent, as <i>they</i> call it, a draught,
but to prevent, as I should call it, health.</p>

<p class='c008'>349. <i>How many hours of sleep ought a boy to have?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This, of course, will depend upon the exercise he
takes; but, on an average, he should have every night
at least eight hours. It is a mistaken notion that a
boy does <i>better</i> with <i>little</i> sleep. Infants, children, and
youths require more than those who are further advanced
in years; hence old people can frequently do with
little sleep. This may in a measure be accounted for
from the quantity of exercise the young take. Another
reason may be, the young have neither pain nor care
to keep them awake; while, on the contrary, the old
have frequently one or both:</p>

  <h4 class='c017'>ON THE TEETH AND THE GUMS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>350. <i>What are the best means of keeping the teeth
and the gums in a healthy state?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I would recommend the teeth and the gums to be
well brushed with warm salt and water, in the proportion
of one large teaspoonful of salt to a tumbler of
water. I was induced to try the above plan by the
recommendation of an intelligent American writer.<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The salt and water should be used <i>every night</i> at
bedtime.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following is an excellent tooth-powder:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of finely-powdered Peruvian Bark;</div>
      <div class='line in10'>„             Prepared Coral;</div>
      <div class='line in10'>„             Prepared Chalk;</div>
      <div class='line in10'>„             Myrrh, of each half an ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in10'>„             Orris root, a quarter of an ounce:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Mix them well together in a mortar, and preserve the powder in a
wide-mouth stoppered bottle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teeth ought to be well brushed with the above
tooth-powder every morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the teeth be much decayed, and if, in consequence,
the breath be offensive, two ounces of finely-powdered
charcoal, well mixed with the above ingredients, will be
found a valuable addition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some persons clean their teeth every morning with
soap; if soap be used it ought to be Castile soap, and
if the teeth be not white and clear, Castile soap is an
excellent cleanser of the teeth, and may be used in lieu
of the tooth-powder as before recommended.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1365'>1365</span>There are few persons who brush the teeth properly.
I will tell you the right way. First of all procure a
tooth-brush of the best make, and of rather hard bristles,
to enable it to penetrate into all the nooks and
corners of the teeth; then, having put a small quantity
of warm water into your mouth, letting the principal
of it escape into the basin, dip your brush in warm
water, and if you are about using Castile soap, rub the
brush on a cake of the soap, and then well brush your
teeth, first upward and then downward, then from side
to side—from right to left and from left to right—then
the backs of the teeth, then apply the brush to the tops
of the crowns of the teeth both of the upper and of the
lower jaw,—so that <i>every</i> part of each tooth, including
the gums, may in turn be well cleansed, and be well
brushed. Be not afraid of using the brush: a good
brushing and dressing will do the teeth and the gums
an immensity of good; it will make the breath sweet,
and will preserve the teeth sound and good. After
using the brush the mouth must, of course, be well
rinsed out with warm water.</p>

<p class='c008'>The finest set of teeth I ever saw in my life belonged
to a middle-aged gentleman; the teeth had neither spot
nor blemish—they were like beautiful pearls. He never
had toothache in his life, and did not know what toothache
meant! He brushed his teeth, every morning,
with soap and water, in the manner I have previously
recommended. I can only say to you—go and do
likewise!</p>

<p class='c008'>Camphor ought never to be used as an ingredient of
tooth-powder, it makes the teeth brittle. Camphor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1366'>1366</span>certainly has the effect of making the teeth, for a time,
look very white; but it is an evanescent beauty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tartar is apt to accumulate between and around the
teeth; it is better in such a case <i>not</i> to remove it by
scaling instruments, but to adopt the plan recommended
by Dr. Richardson, namely, to well brush the
teeth with pure vinegar and water.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>PREVENTION OF DISEASE, <span class='sc'>Etc.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>351. <i>If a boy or a girl show great precocity of intellect,
is any organ likely to become affected?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A greater quantity of arterial blood is sent to the
brain of those who are prematurely talented, and hence
it becomes more than ordinarily developed. Such advantages
are not unmixed with danger; this same
arterial blood may excite and feed inflammation, and
either convulsions, or water on the brain, or insanity,
or, at last, idiocy may follow. How proud a mother is
in having a precocious child! How little is she aware
that precocity is frequently an indication of disease!</p>

<p class='c008'>352. <i>How can danger in such a case be warded off?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It behooves a parent, if her son be precocious, to restrain
him—to send him to a quiet country place, free
from the excitement of the town; and when he is sent
to school, to give directions to the master that he is
not on any account to tax his intellect (for a master is
apt, if he have a clever boy, to urge him forward); and
to keep him from those institutions where a spirit of
rivalry is maintained, and where the brain is thus kept
in a state of constant excitement. Medals and prizes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1367'>1367</span>are well enough for those who have moderate abilities,
but dangerous, indeed, to those who have brilliant ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>An overworked precocious brain is apt to cause the
death of the owner; and if it does not do so, it in too
many instances injures the brain irreparably, and the
possessor of such an organ, from being one of the most
intellectual of children, becomes one of the most commonplace
of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me urge you, if you have a precocious child, to
give, and that before it be too late, the subject in question
your best consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>353. <i>Are precocious boys in their general health
usually strong or delicate?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Delicate. Nature seems to have given a delicate
body to compensate for the advantages of a talented
mind. A precocious youth is predisposed to consumption,
more so than to any other disease. The hard
study which he frequently undergoes excites the disease
into action. It is not desirable, therefore, to have
a precocious child. A writer in “Fraser’s Magazine”
speaks very much to the purpose when he says, “Give
us intellectual beef rather than intellectual veal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>354. <i>What habit of body is most predisposed to Scrofula?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He or she who has a moist, cold, fair, delicate, and
almost transparent skin, large prominent blue eyes,
protuberant forehead, light-brown or auburn hair, rosy
cheeks, pouting lips, milk-white teeth, long neck, high
shoulders, small, flat, and contracted chest, tumid bowels,
large joints, thin limbs, and flabby muscles, is the
person most predisposed to scrofula. The disease is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1368'>1368</span>not entirely confined to the above; sometimes he or she
who has black hair, dark eyes and complexion, is subject
to it, but yet far less frequently than the former.
It is a remarkable fact that the most talented are the
most prone to scrofula, and being thus clever their intellects
are too often cultivated at the expense of their
health. In infancy and childhood, either water on the
brain or mesenteric disease; in youth, pulmonary consumption
is frequently their doom. They, are like
shining meteors; their life is brilliant, but short.</p>

<p class='c008'>355. <i>How may Scrofula be warded off?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Strict attention to the rules of health is the means
to prevent scrofula. Books, unless as an amusement,
ought to be discarded. The patient must almost live
in the open air, and his residence should be a healthy
country place, where the air is dry and bracing; if it
be at a farm-house, in a salubrious neighborhood, so
much the better. In selecting a house for a patient
predisposed to scrofula, <i>good pure water should be an
important requisite</i>—indeed for every one who values
his health. Early rising in such a case is most beneficial.
Wine, spirits, and all fermented liquors ought
to be avoided. Beef-steaks and mutton-chops in abundance,
and plenty of milk and farinaceous food—such as
rice, sago, arrow-root, etc.—should be his diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scrofula, if the above rules be strictly and perseveringly
followed, may be warded off; but there must be
no half measures, no trying to serve two masters—to
cultivate at the same time the health and the intellect.
The brain, until the body becomes strong, must <i>not</i> be
taxed. “You may prevent scrofula by care; but that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1369'>1369</span>some children are originally predisposed to the disease
there cannot be the least doubt, and in such cases the
education and the habits of youth should be so directed
as to ward off a complaint the effects of which are so
frequently fatal.”<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>356. <i>But suppose the disease to be already formed,
what must then be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The plan recommended above must still be pursued,
not by fits and starts, but steadily and continuously,
for it is a complaint that requires a vast deal of patience
and great perseverance. Warm and cold sea-bathing
in such a case is generally most beneficial. In
a patient with confirmed scrofula it will of course be
necessary to consult a skillful and experienced doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>But do not allow, without a second opinion, any plan
to be adopted that will weaken the system, which is
already too much depressed. No, rather build up the
body by good nourishing diet (as previously recommended),
by cod-liver oil, by a dry, bracing atmosphere,
such as either Brighton, or Ramsgate, Llandudno; or,
if the lungs be delicate, by a more sheltered coast, such
as either St. Leonard’s or Torquay.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let no active purging, no mercurials, no violent, desperate
remedies be allowed. If the patient cannot be
cured <i>without</i> them, I am positive that he will not be
cured <i>with</i> them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But do not despair; many scrofulous patients are
cured by time and by judicious treatment. But if desperate
remedies are to be used, the poor patient had
better <i>by far</i> be left to Nature. “Let me fall now into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1370'>1370</span>the hand of the <span class='sc'>Lord</span>; for very great are his mercies:
but let me not fall into the hand of man.”<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>357. <i>Have you any remarks to make on a girl
stooping?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A girl ought never to be allowed to stoop: stooping
spoils the figure, weakens the chest, and interferes with
the digestion. If she cannot help stooping, you may
depend upon it that she is in bad health, and that a
medical man ought to be consulted. As soon as her
health is improved the dancing-master should be put
in requisition, and calisthenic and gymnastic exercises
should be resorted to. Horse exercise and swimming
in such a case are very beneficial. The girl should
live well, on good nourishing diet, and not be too
closely confined either to the house or to her lessons.
She ought during the night to lie on a horse-hair mattress,
and during the day, for two or three hours, flat
on her back on a reclining board. Stooping, if neglected,
is very likely to lead to consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>358. <i>If a boy be round-shouldered and slouching in
his gait, what ought to be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Let him be drilled; there is nothing more likely to
benefit him than drilling. You never see a soldier
round-shouldered nor slouching in his gait. He walks
every inch like a man. Look at the difference in appearance
between a country laborer and a soldier! It
is the drilling that makes the difference. “Oh, for a
drill-sergeant to teach them to stand upright, and to
turn out their toes, and to get rid of that slouching,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1371'>1371</span>hulking gait, which gives such a look of clumsiness
and stupidity!”<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>359. <i>My daughter has grown out of shape, she has
grown on one side, her spine is not straight, and her
ribs bulge out more on the one side than on the other:
what is the cause, and can anything be done to remedy
the deformity?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The causes of this lateral curvature of the spine, and
consequent bulging out of the ribs that you have just
now described, arise either from delicacy of constitution,
from the want of proper exercise, from too much
learning, or from too little play, or from not sufficient
or proper nourishment for a rapidly-growing body. I
am happy to say that such a case, by judicious treatment,
can generally be cured—namely, by gymnastic
exercises, such as the hand-swing, the fly-pole, the
patent parlor gymnasium, the chest expander, the
skipping-rope, the swimming bath; all sorts of out-door
games, such as croquet, archery, etc.; by plenty
of good nourishment, by making her a child of Nature,
by letting her almost live in the open air, and by throwing
books to the winds. But let me strongly urge you
not, unless ordered by an experienced surgeon, to allow
any mechanical restraints or appliances to be used. If
she be made strong, the muscles themselves will pull
both the spine and the ribs into their proper places, more
especially if judicious games and exercises (as I have
before advised), and other treatment of a strengthening
and bracing nature, which a medical man will indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1372'>1372</span>to you, be enjoined. Mechanical appliances will, if not
judiciously applied, and in a proper case, waste away
the muscles, and will thus increase the mischief; if they
cause the ribs to be pushed in in one place, they will
bulge them out in another, until, instead of being one,
there will be a series of deformities. No, the giving
of strength and the judicious exercising of the muscles
are, for a lateral curvature of the spine and the consequent
bulging out of one side of the ribs, the proper
remedies, and, in the majority of cases, are most effectual,
and quite sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>I think it well to strongly impress upon a mother’s
mind the great importance of early treatment. If the
above advice be followed, every curvature in the beginning
might be cured. Cases of several years’ standing
might, with judicious treatment, be wonderfully relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bear in mind, then, that if the girl is to be made
straight, she is first of all to be made strong; the latter,
together with the proper exercises of the muscles, will
lead to the former; and the <i>earlier</i> a medical man
takes it in hand, the more rapid, the more certain, and
the more effectual will be the cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>An inveterate, long-continued and neglected case of
curvature of the spine and bulging out of the ribs on
one side might require mechanical appliances, but such a
case can only be decided on by an experienced surgeon,
who ought always, <i>in the first place</i>, to be consulted.</p>

<p class='c008'>360. <i>Is a slight spitting of blood to be looked upon
as a dangerous symptom?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Spitting of blood is always to be looked upon with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1373'>1373</span>suspicion, even when a youth appears in other respects
to be in good health; it is frequently the forerunner of
consumption. It might be said that, by mentioning
the fact, I am unnecessarily alarming a parent, but it
would be a false kindness if I did not do so:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I must be cruel only to be kind.”<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c014'><sup>[298]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Let me ask when is consumption to be cured? Is it
at the onset, or is it when it is confirmed? If a mother
had been more generally aware that spitting of blood
was frequently the forerunner of consumption, she
would, in the management of her offspring, have taken
greater precautions; she would have made everything
give way to the preservation of their health; and, in
many instances, she would have been amply repaid by
having the lives of her children spared to her. We
frequently hear of patients in <i>confirmed</i> consumption
being sent to Mentone, to Madeira, and to other foreign
parts. Can anything be more cruel or absurd? If
there be any disease that requires the comforts of
home—and truly may an Englishman’s dwelling be
called <i>home</i>!—and good nursing more than another,
it is consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>361. <i>What is the death-rate of Consumption in England?
At what age does Consumption most frequently
occur? Are girls more liable to it than boys? What
are the symptoms of this disease?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It is asserted, on good authority,<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c014'><sup>[299]</sup></a> that there always
are, in England, 78,000 cases of consumption, and that
the yearly death-rate of this fell disease alone is 39,000!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1374'>1374</span>Consumption more frequently shows itself between the
ages of fourteen and twenty-one; after then, the liability
to the disease gradually diminishes, until at the
age of forty-five it becomes comparatively rare. Boys
are more prone to this complaint than girls. Some of
the most important symptoms of pulmonary consumption
are indicated by the stethoscope; but, as I am
addressing a mother, it would, of course, be quite out
of place to treat of such signs in Conversations of this
kind. The symptoms it might be well for a parent to
recognize, in order that she may seek aid early, I will
presently describe. It is perfectly hopeless to expect
to cure consumption unless advice be sought at the
<i>onset</i>, as the only effectual good in this disease is to be
done at <i>first</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It might be well to state that consumption creeps
on insidiously. One of the earliest symptoms of this
dreadful scourge is a slight, dry, short cough, attended
with tickling and irritation at the top of the throat.
This cough generally occurs in the morning; but, after
some time, comes on at night, and gradually throughout
the day and the night. Frequently during the early
stage of the disease <i>a slight spitting of blood occurs</i>.
Now this is a most dangerous symptom; indeed, I may
go so far as to say that, as a rule, it is almost a sure
sign that the patient is in the <i>first</i> stage of a consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is usually hoarseness, not constant, but coming
on if the patient be tired, or toward the evening;
there is also a sense of lassitude and depression, shortness
of breathing, a feeling of being quickly wearied—more
especially on the slightest exertion. The hair of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1375'>1375</span>a consumptive person usually falls off, and what little
remains is weak and poor; the joints of the fingers become
enlarged, or clubbed as it is sometimes called;
the patient loses flesh, and, after some time, night-sweats
make their appearance; then we may know
that hectic fever has commenced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hectic begins with chilliness, which is soon followed
by flushings of the face, and by burning heat of the
hands and feet, especially of the palms and the soles.
This is soon succeeded by perspirations. The patient
has generally, during the day, two decided paroxysms
of hectic fever—the one at noon, which lasts about five
hours, the other in the evening, which is more severe,
and ends in violent perspirations, which perspirations
continue the whole night through. He may, during
the day, have several attacks of hectic flushes of the face,
especially after eating; at one moment he complains of
being too hot, and rushes to the cool air; the next
moment he is too cold, and almost scorches himself by
sitting too near the fire. Whenever the circumscribed
hectic flush is on the cheek, it looks as though the
cheek had been painted with vermilion, then is the
time when the palms of the hands are burning hot.</p>

<p class='c008'>The expectoration at first is merely mucus, but after
a time it assumes a characteristic appearance; it has a
roundish, flocculent, woolly form, each portion of phlegm
keeping, as it were, distinct; and if the expectoration
be stirred in water, it has a milk-like appearance. The
patient is commonly harassed by frequent bowel complaints,
which rob him of what little strength he has
left. The feet and ankles swell. The perspiration, as
before remarked, comes on in the evening, continues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1376'>1376</span>all night, more especially toward morning and while
the patient is asleep; during the time he is awake,
even at night, he seldom sweats much. The thrush
generally shows itself toward the close of the disease,
attacking the tongue, the tonsils, and the soft palate,
<i>and is a sure harbinger of approaching death</i>. Emaciation
rapidly sets in.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we consider the immense engines of destruction
at work—viz., the colliquative (melting) sweats, the
violent bowel complaints, the vital parts that are
affected, the harassing cough, the profuse expectoration,
the hectic fever, the distressing exertion of struggling
to breathe,—we cannot be surprised that “consumption
had hung out her red flag of no surrender,”
and that death soon closes the scene. In girls, provided
they have been previously regular, menstruation
gradually declines, and then entirely disappears.</p>

<p class='c008'>362. <i>What are the causes of Consumption?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>predisposing</i> causes of consumption are the
scrofulous habit of body, hereditary predisposition,
narrow or contracted chest, deformed spine, delicacy of
constitution, bad and scanty diet, or food containing
but little nourishment, impure air, close in-door confinement
in schools, in shops, and in factories, ill-ventilated
apartments, dissipation, late hours, overtaxing
with book learning the growing brain, thus producing
debility, want of proper out-door exercises and
amusements, tight lacing—indeed, anything and everything
that either will debilitate the constitution, or
will interfere with or will impede the proper action of
the lungs, will be the predisposing causes of this fearful
and lamentable disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1377'>1377</span>An ill, poor, and insufficient diet is the mother of
many diseases, and especially of consumption: “Whatsoever
was the father of a disease, an ill diet was the
mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The most common <i>exciting</i> causes of consumption
are slighted colds, neglected inflammation of the chest,
long continuance of influenza, sleeping in damp beds,
allowing wet clothes to dry on the body, unhealthy
employments—such as needle grinding, pearl-button
making, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>363. <i>Supposing a youth to have spitting of blood,
what precautions would you take to prevent it from
ending in Consumption?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I should let his health be the first consideration; I
should throw books to the winds; if he be at school, I
should advise you to take him away; if he be in trade,
I should cancel his indentures; if he be in the town,
I should send him to a sheltered healthy spot in the
country, or to the south coast; as, for instance, either
to St. Leonards-on-Sea, or to Torquay.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should be particular in his clothing, taking especial
care to keep his chest and feet warm. If he did not
already wear flannel waistcoats, let it be winter or
summer, I should recommend him immediately to do
so; if it be winter, I should advise him also to take
to <i>flannel</i> drawers. The feet must be carefully attended
to; they ought to be kept both warm and dry, the
slightest dampness of either shoes or stockings should
cause them to be immediately changed. If a boy, he
ought to wear double-breasted waistcoats; if a girl,
high dresses.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1378'>1378</span>The diet must be nutritious and generous; he should
be encouraged to eat plentifully of beef and mutton.
There is nothing better for breakfast, where it agrees,
than milk; indeed, it may be frequently made to agree
by previously boiling it. Good home-brewed ale or
sound porter ought, in moderation, to be taken. Wine
and spirits must on no account be allowed. I caution
parents in this particular, as many have an idea that
wine, in such cases, is strengthening, and that <i>rum</i>
and milk is a good thing either to cure or to prevent a
cough!</p>

<p class='c008'>If it be summer, let him be much in the open air,
avoiding the evening and the night air. If it be winter,
he should, unless the weather be mild for the season,
keep within doors. Particular attention ought to
be paid to the point the wind is in, as he should not
be allowed to go out if it is either in the north, in the
east, or in the northeast; the latter is more especially
dangerous. If it be spring, and the weather be favorable,
or summer or autumn, change of air, more especially
to the south coast—to the Isle of Wight, for
instance—would be desirable; indeed, in a case of
spitting of blood, I know of no remedy so likely to
ward off that formidable, and, generally, intractable
complaint—consumption—as change of air. The beginning
of the autumn is, of course, the best season
for visiting the coast. It would be advisable, at the
commencement of October, to send him either to Italy,
to the south of France—to Mentone<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c014'><sup>[300]</sup></a>—or to the mild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1379'>1379</span>parts of England—more especially either to Hastings,
or to Torquay, or to the Isle of Wight—to winter.
But remember, if he be actually in a <i>confirmed</i> consumption,
I would not, on any account whatever, let
him leave his home; as then the comforts of home will
far, very far outweigh any benefit of change of air.</p>

<p class='c008'>364. <i>Suppose a youth to be much predisposed to a
Sore-Throat, what precautions ought he to take to ward
off future attacks?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>He must use every morning thorough ablution of the
body, beginning cautiously; that is to say, commencing
with the neck one morning, then by degrees, morning
after morning, sponging a larger surface, until the whole
of the body be sponged. The chill at first must be
taken off the water; gradually the temperature ought
to be lowered until the water be quite cold, taking care
to rub the body thoroughly dry with a coarse towel—a
Turkish rubber being the best for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>He ought to bathe his throat externally every night
and morning with lukewarm salt and water, the temperature
of which must be gradually reduced until at
length no warm water be added. He should gargle his
throat either with barm, vinegar, and sage tea,<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a> or
with salt and water—two teaspoonfuls of table salt
dissolved in a tumbler of water. He ought to harden
himself by taking plenty of exercise in the open air.
He must, as much as possible, avoid either sitting or
standing in a draught; if he be in one he should face
it. He ought to keep his feet warm and dry. He should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1380'>1380</span>take as little aperient medicine as possible, avoiding
especially both calomel and blue-pill. As he grows up
to manhood he ought to allow his beard to grow, as
such would be a natural covering for his throat: I have
known great benefit to arise from this simple plan.
The fashion is now to wear the beard, not to use the
razor at all, and a sensible fashion I consider it to be.
The finest respirator in the world is the beard. The
beard is not only good for sore throats, but for weak
chests. The wearing of the beard is a splendid innovation;
it saves no end of trouble, is very beneficial to
health, and is a great improvement “to the human face
divine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>365. <i>Have you any remarks to make on the almost
universal habit of boys and of very young men smoking?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>I am not now called upon to give an opinion of the
effects of tobacco smoking on the middle-aged and on
the aged. I am addressing a mother as to the desirability
of her sons, when boys, being allowed to smoke.
I consider tobacco smoking one of the most injurious
and deadly habits a boy or a young man can indulge
in. It contracts the chest and weakens the lungs, thus
predisposing to consumption. It impairs the stomach,
thus producing indigestion. It debilitates the brain
and nervous system, thus inducing epileptic fits and
nervous depression. It stunts the growth, and is one
cause of the present race of pigmies. It makes the
young lazy and disinclined for work. It is one of the
greatest curses of the present day. The following cases
prove, more than any argument can prove, the dangerous
and deplorable effects of a boy smoking. I copy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1381'>1381</span>the first case from <cite>Public Opinion</cite>.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a> “The <cite>France</cite>
mentions the following fact as a proof of the evil consequences
of smoking for boys: ‘A pupil in one of the
colleges, only twelve years of age, was some time since
seized with epileptic fits, which became worse and
worse in spite of all the remedies employed. At last
it was discovered that the lad had been for two years
past secretly indulging in the weed. Effectual means
were adopted to prevent his obtaining tobacco, and he
soon recovered.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other case occurred about five years ago, in my
own practice. The patient was a youth of nineteen.
He was an inveterate smoker. From being a bright,
intelligent lad, he was becoming idiotic, and epileptic
fits were supervening. I painted to him, in vivid colors,
the horrors of his case, and assured him that if he still
persisted in his bad practices, he would soon become
a driveling idiot! I at length, after some trouble and
contention, prevailed upon him to desist from smoking
altogether. He rapidly lost all epileptic symptoms, his
face soon resumed its wonted intelligence, and his mind
asserted its former power. He remains well to this day,
and is now a married man with a family.</p>

<p class='c008'>366. <i>What are the best methods to restrain a violent
Bleeding from the Nose?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Do not interfere with a bleeding from the nose unless
it be violent. A bleeding from the nose is frequently
an effort of Nature to relieve itself, and therefore,
unless it be likely to weaken the patient, ought not to
be restrained. If it be necessary to restrain the bleeding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1382'>1382</span>press firmly for a few minutes the nose between
the finger and the thumb—this alone will often stop
the bleeding; if it should not, then try what bathing
the nose and the forehead and the nape of the neck
with water quite cold from the pump will do. If that
does not succeed, try the old-fashioned remedy of putting
a cold large door-key down the back. If these
plans fail, try the effects either of powdered alum or
of powdered matico, used after the fashion of snuff—a
pinch or two, either of the one or the other, or of both,
should be sniffed up the bleeding nostril. If these
should not answer the purpose, although they almost
invariably will, apply a large lump of ice to the nape
of the neck, and put a small piece of ice into the patient’s
mouth for him to suck.</p>

<p class='c008'>If these methods do not succeed, plunge the hand
and the forearm into cold water, keep them in for a
few minutes, then take them out, and either hold or
let be held up the arms and hands high above the head;
this plan has frequently succeeded when others have
failed. Let the room be kept cool, throw open the
windows, and do not have many in the room to crowd
around the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doubtless, Dr. Richardson’s local anæsthetic—the
ether spray—playing from a few seconds to a minute
<i>on</i> the nose and <i>up</i> the bleeding nostril, would act
most beneficially in a severe case of this kind, and
would, before resorting to the disagreeable operation
of plugging the nose, deserve a trial. I respectfully
submit this suggestion to my medical brethren. The
ether—rectified ether—used for the spray ought to be
perfectly pure, and of the specific gravity of 0.723.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1383'>1383</span>If the above treatment does not soon succeed, send
for a medical man, as more active means, such as plugging
of the nostrils—<i>which is not done unless in extreme
cases</i>—might be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>But before plugging of the nose is resorted to, it will
be well to try the effects of a cold solution of alum:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Powdered Alum, one drachm;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Water, half a pint:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Lotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little of the lotion should be put into the palm of
the hand and sniffed up the bleeding nostril; or, if that
does not succeed, some of the lotion ought, by means
of a syringe, to be syringed up the nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>367. <i>In case of a young lady Fainting, what had
better be done?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Lay her flat upon her back, taking care that the head
be as low as or lower than the body; throw open the
windows; do not crowd around her;<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a> unloosen her
dress as quickly as possible; ascertain if she have
been guilty of tight lacing, for fainting is sometimes
produced by that reprehensible practice. Apply smelling-salts
to her nostrils; if they be not at hand, burn
a piece of rag under her nose; dash cold water upon
her face; throw open the window; fan her; and do
not, as is generally done, crowd round her, and thus
prevent a free circulation of air.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1384'>1384</span>As soon as she can swallow, give her either a draught
of <i>cold</i> water, or a glass of wine, or a teaspoonful of sal-volatile
in a wineglassful of water.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To prevent fainting for the future.</i>—I would recommend
early hours; country air and exercise; the stays,
if worn at all, to be worn slack; attention to diet;
avoidance of wine, beer, spirits, excitement, and fashionable
amusements.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the cause of a young lady fainting is
either a disordered stomach or a constipated state of
the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the fainting have been caused by <i>disordered
stomach</i>, it may be necessary to stop the supplies, and
give the stomach, for a day or two, but little to do; a
fast will frequently prevent the necessity of giving
medicine. Of course, if the stomach be <i>much</i> disordered,
it will be desirable to consult a medical man.</p>

<p class='c008'>If your daughter’s fainting have originated from a
<i>costive state of the bowels</i> (another frequent cause of
fainting), I beg to refer you to a subsequent Conversation,
in which I will give you a list of remedies for the
prevention and the treatment of constipation.</p>

<p class='c008'>A young lady’s fainting occasionally arises from
debility—from downright weakness of the constitution;
then the best remedies will be change of air to the
coast, good nourishing diet, and the following strengthening
mixture:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Muriated Tincture of Iron, one drachm and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Tincture of Calumba, six drachms;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, seven ounces.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Two tablespoonfuls of this mixture to be taken three times a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or, for a change, the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1385'>1385</span>Take of—Wine of Iron, one ounce and a half;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Distilled Water, six ounces and a half:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make a Mixture. Two tablespoonfuls to be taken three times a
day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Iron medicines ought always to be taken <i>after</i> instead
of <i>before</i> a meal. The best times of the day for
taking either of the above mixtures will be eleven
o’clock, four o’clock, and seven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>368. <i>You had a great objection to a mother administering
calomel either to an infant or to a child, have
you the same objection to a boy or a girl taking it when
he or she requires an aperient?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Equally as great. It is my firm belief that the frequent
use, or rather the abuse, of calomel and of other
preparations of mercury, is often a source of liver disease,
and an exciter of scrofula. It is a medicine of
great value in some diseases, when given by a <i>judicious</i>
medical man; but, at the same time, it is a drug of
great danger when either given indiscriminately, or
when too often prescribed. I will grant that in liver
diseases it frequently gives temporary relief; but when
a patient has once commenced the regular use of it, he
cannot do without it, until, at length, the <i>functional</i>
ends in <i>organic</i> disease of the liver. The use of calomel
predisposes to cold, and thus frequently brings on
either inflammation or consumption. Family aperient
pills ought never to contain, in any form whatever, a
particle of mercury.</p>

<p class='c008'>369. <i>Will you give me a list of remedies for the
prevention and for the cure of Constipation?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If you find it necessary to give to your son or to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1386'>1386</span>your daughter aperient medicine, the mildest ought to
be selected; for instance, an agreeable and an effectual
one is an electuary composed of the following ingredients:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Best picked Alexandria Senna, one ounce;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Best Figs, two ounces;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Best Raisins (stoned), two ounces:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>All chopped very fine. The size of a nutmeg or two to be occasionally
eaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>Or, one or two teaspoonfuls of compound confection
of senna (lenitive electuary) may occasionally, early in
the morning, be taken. Or, for a change, a teaspoonful
of Henry’s magnesia, in half a tumblerful of warm
water. If this should not be sufficiently active, a teaspoonful
of Epsom salts should be given with the magnesia.
A Seidlitz powder forms another safe and mild
aperient; or one or two compound rhubarb pills may
be given at bedtime. The following prescription for
a pill, where an aperient is absolutely necessary, is a
mild, gentle, and effective one for the purpose:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Take of—Extract of Socotrine Aloes, eight grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Compound Extract of Colocynth, forty-eight grains:</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Hard Soap, twenty-four grains;</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Treacle, a sufficient quantity:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>To make twenty-four Pills. One or two to be taken at bedtime
occasionally.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, after all, the best opening medicines are—cold
ablutions every morning of the whole body; attention
to diet; variety of food; bran-bread; grapes; stewed
prunes;<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c014'><sup>[304]</sup></a> French plums; Muscatel raisins; figs; fruit
both cooked and raw—if it be ripe and sound; oatmeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1387'>1387</span>porridge; lentil powder, in the form of Du Barry’s Arabica
Revalenta; vegetables of all kinds, especially
spinach; exercise in the open air; early rising; daily
visiting the water-closet at a certain hour—there is
nothing keeps the bowels open so regularly and well as
establishing the habit of visiting the water-closet at a
certain hour every morning; and the other rules of
health specified in these Conversations. If more attention
were paid to these points, poor school-boys and
school-girls would not be compelled to swallow such
nauseous and disgusting messes as they usually are.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should these plans not succeed (although in the majority
of cases, with patience and perseverance, they
will), I would advise an enema once or twice a week,
either simply of warm water, or of one made of gruel,
table salt, and olive oil, in the proportion of two tablespoonfuls
of salt, two of oil, and a pint of warm gruel,
which a boy may administer to himself, or a girl to herself,
by means of a proper enema apparatus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hydropathy is oftentimes very serviceable in preventing
and in curing costiveness; and as it will
sometimes prevent the necessity of administering medicine,
it is both a boon and a blessing. “Hydropathy
also supplies us with various remedies for constipation.
From the simple glass of cold water, taken early in the
morning, to the various douches and sea-baths, a long
list of useful appliances might be made out, among
which we may mention the ‘wet compresses’ worn for
three hours over the abdomen [bowels], with a gutta-percha
covering.”<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c014'><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1388'>1388</span>I have here a word or two to say to a mother who is
always physicking her family. It is an unnatural thing
to be constantly dosing either a child or any one else
with medicine. One would suppose that some people
were only sent into the world to be physicked! If
more care were paid to the rules of health, very little
medicine would be required! This is a bold assertion;
but I am confident that it is a true one. It is a strange
admission for a medical man to make, but, nevertheless,
my convictions compel me to avow it.</p>

<p class='c008'>370. <i>What is the reason girls are so subject to Costiveness?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The principal reason why girls suffer more from costiveness
than boys, is that their habits are more sedentary;
as the best opening medicines in the world are
an abundance of exercise, of muscular exertion, and of
fresh air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unfortunately, poor girls in this enlightened age
must be engaged, sitting all the while, several hours
every day at fancy work, the piano, and other accomplishments,
they, consequently, have little time for
exercise of any kind. The bowels, as a matter of
course, become constipated; they are, therefore, dosed
with pills, with black draughts, with brimstone and
treacle—oh! the abomination!—and with medicines of
that class, almost <i>ad infinitum</i>. What is the consequence?
Opening medicines, by constant repetition,
lose their effects, and, therefore, require to be made
stronger and still stronger, until at length the strongest
will scarcely act at all, and the poor unfortunate girl,
when she becomes a woman, <i>if she ever does become
one</i>, is spiritless, heavy, dull, and listless, requiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1389'>1389</span>daily doses of physic, until she almost lives on medicine!</p>

<p class='c008'>All this misery and wretchedness proceed from Nature’s
laws having been set at defiance, from <i>artificial</i>
means taking the place of <i>natural</i> ones—from a mother
adopting as her rule and guide fashion and folly, rather
than reason and common sense. When will a mother
awake from her folly and stupidity? This is strong
language to address to a lady; but it is not stronger
than the subject demands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mothers of England! do, let me entreat you, ponder
well upon what I have said. Do rescue your girls
from the bondage of fashion and folly, which is worse
than the bondage of the Egyptian task-masters; for
the Israelites did, in making bricks without straw,
work in the open air—“So the people were scattered
abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather
stubble instead of straw;”<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a> but your girls, many of
them at least, have no work, either in the house or in
the open air—they have no exercise whatever. They
are poor, drawling, dawdling, miserable nonentities,
with muscles, for the want of proper exercise, like
ribbons; and with faces, for the lack of fresh air, as
white as a sheet of paper. What a host of charming
girls are yearly sacrificed at the shrine of fashion and
of folly!</p>

<p class='c008'>Another, and a frequent cause of costiveness, is the
bad habit of disobeying the call of having the bowels
opened. The moment there is the slightest inclination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1390'>1390</span>to relieve the bowels, <i>instantly</i> ought it to be attended
to, or serious results will follow. Let me urge a mother
to instill into her daughter’s mind the importance of
this advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>371. <i>Young people are subject to Pimples on the
Face, what is the remedy?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>These hard red pimples (<i>acne</i>) are a common and an
obstinate affection of the skin, principally affecting the
forehead, the temples, the nose, and the cheeks; occasionally
attacking the neck, the shoulders, the back, and
the chest; and as they more frequently affect the
young, from the age of 15 to 35, and are disfiguring,
they cause much annoyance. “These pimples are so
well known by most persons as scarcely to need description;
they are conical, red, and hard; after awhile,
they become white, and yellow at the point, then discharge
a thick yellow-colored matter, mingled with a
whitish substance, and become covered by a hard,
brown scab, and lastly, disappear very slowly, sometimes
very imperfectly, and often leaving an ugly scar
behind them. To these symptoms are not unfrequently
added considerable pain, and always much unsightliness.
When these little cones have the black head of
a ‘grub’ at their point, they constitute the variety
termed <i>spotted acne</i>. These latter often remain stationary
for months, without increasing or becoming
red; but when they inflame, they are nowise different
in their course from the common kind.”<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I find, in these cases, great benefit to be derived
from bathing the face, night and morning, with strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1391'>1391</span>salt and water—a tablespoonful of table salt to a teacupful
of water; by paying attention to the bowels;
by living on plain, wholesome, nourishing food; and by
taking a great deal of out-door exercise. Sea bathing,
in these cases, is often very beneficial. Grubs and
worms have a mortal antipathy to salt.</p>

<p class='c008'>372. <i>What is the cause of a Gum-boil?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>A decayed root of a tooth, which causes inflammation
and abscess of the gum, which abscess breaks, and
thus becomes a gum-boil.</p>

<p class='c008'>373. <i>What is the treatment of a Gum-boil?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Foment the outside of the face with a hot chamomile
and poppy-head fomentation,<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a> and apply to the gum-boil,
between the cheek and the gum, a small white-bread
and milk poultice,<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a> which renew frequently.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the gum-boil has become quiet, <i>by all
means</i> have the affected tooth extracted, or it might
cause disease, and consequently serious injury of the
jaw; and whenever the patient catches cold there will
be a renewal of the inflammation, of the abscess, and
of the gum-boil, and, as a matter of course, renewed
pain, trouble, and annoyance. Moreover, decayed fangs
of teeth often cause the breath to be offensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>374. <i>What is the best remedy for a Corn?</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1392'>1392</span>The best remedy for a <i>hard corn</i> is to remove it.
The usual method of cutting, or of paring a corn
away, is erroneous. The following is the right way:
Cut with a <i>sharp</i> pair of pointed scissors around the
circumference of the corn. Work gradually round
and round and toward the center. When you have
for some considerable distance well loosened the edges,
you can either with your finger or with a pair of forceps
generally remove the corn bodily, and that with
little pain and without the loss of any blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the corn be properly and wholly removed, it will
leave a small cavity or round hole in the center, where
the blood-vessels and the nerve of the corn—vulgarly
called the root—really were, and which, in point of
fact, constituted the very existence or the essence of
the corn. Moreover, if the corn be entirely removed,
you will, without giving yourself the slightest pain,
be able to squeeze the part affected between your
finger and thumb.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Hard corns</i> on the sole of the foot and on the sides
of the foot are best treated by filing—by filing them
with a sharp cutting file (flat on one side and convex
on the other), neither too coarse nor too fine in the cutting.
The corn ought, once every day, to be filed, and
should daily be continued until you experience a slight
pain, which tells you that the end of the corn is
approaching. Many cases of <i>hard corn</i>, that have resisted
every other plan of treatment, have been <i>entirely</i>
cured by means of the file. One great advantage of the
file is, it cannot possibly do any harm, and may be used
by a timid person, by one who would not readily submit
to any cutting instrument being applied to the corn.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1393'>1393</span>The file, if properly used, is an effectual remedy for a
<i>hard</i> corn on the sole of the foot. I myself have seen
the value of it in several cases, particularly in one case,
that of an old gentleman of ninety-five, who had had a
corn on the sole of his foot for upwards of half a century,
and which had resisted numerous, indeed, almost
innumerable remedies; at length I recommended the
file, and after a few applications entire relief was obtained,
and the corn was completely eradicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The corns between the toes are called <i>soft corns</i>.
A <i>soft corn</i> is quickly removed by the strong acetic
acid—acid. acetic. fort.—which ought to be applied
to the corn every night by means of a camel’s-hair
brush. The toes should be kept asunder for a few
minutes, in order that the acid may soak in; then
apply between the toes a small piece of cotton wool.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Hard corns</i>, then, on the sole and on the side of the
foot, are best treated by the file; <i>hard corns</i> on the
toes by the scissors; and <i>soft corns</i> between the toes
by the strong acetic acid.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the generality of cases the plans recommended
above, if properly performed, will effect a cure; but if
the corn, from pressure or from any other cause, should
return, remove it again and proceed as before directed.
If the corn have been caused either by tight or by ill-fitting
shoes, the only way to prevent a recurrence is,
of course, to have the shoes properly made by a clever
shoemaker—by one who thoroughly understands his
business, and who will have a pair of lasts made purposely
for the feet.<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1394'>1394</span>The German method of making boots and shoes is a
capital one for the prevention of corns, as the boots and
shoes are made scientifically, to fit a <i>real</i> and not an
<i>ideal</i> foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the best preventives of, as well as of the
best remedies for corns, especially of soft corns between
the toes, is washing the feet every morning, as recommended
in a previous Conversation,<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a> taking especial
care to wash with the thumb, and afterward to wipe
with the towel between each toe.</p>

<p class='c008'>375. <i>What is the best remedy to destroy a Wart?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Pure nitric acid,<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a> carefully applied to the wart by
means of a small stick of cedar wood, a camel’s-hair
pencil-holder, every other day, will soon destroy it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1395'>1395</span>Care must be taken that the acid does not touch the
healthy skin, or it will act as a caustic to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nitric acid should be preserved in a stoppered
bottle, and must be put out of the reach of children.</p>

<p class='c008'>376. <i>What is the best remedy for Tender Feet, for
Sweaty Feet, and for Smelling Feet?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Cold water: bathing the feet in cold water, beginning
with tepid water; but gradually from day to day
reducing the warm until the water be quite cold. A
large nursery-basin, one-third full of water, ought to be
placed on the floor, and one foot at a time should be
put in the water, washing the while with a sponge the
foot, and with the thumb between each toe. Each
foot should remain in the water about half a minute.
The feet ought after each washing to be well dried,
taking care to dry with the towel between each toe.
The above process must be repeated at least once every
day, every morning, and, if the annoyance be great,
every night as well. A clean pair of stockings ought
in these cases to be put on daily, as perfect cleanliness
is absolutely necessary both to afford relief and to effect
a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the feet be tender, or if there be either bunions or
corns, the shoes and the boots made according to the
German method (which are fashioned according to the
actual shape of the foot) should alone be worn.</p>

<p class='c008'>377. <i>What are the causes of so many young ladies
of the present day being weak, nervous, and unhappy?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The principal causes are—ignorance of the laws of
health, Nature’s laws being set at naught by fashion
and by folly, by want of fresh air and exercise, by want
of occupation, and by want of self-reliance. Weak,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1396'>1396</span>nervous, and unhappy! Well they might be! What
have they to make them strong and happy? Have
they work to do to brace the muscles? Have they
occupation—useful, active occupation—to make them
happy? No! they have neither the one nor the other!</p>

<p class='c008'>378. <i>What diseases are girls most subject to?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The diseases peculiar to girls are—Chlorosis, Greensickness,
and Hysterics.</p>

<p class='c008'>379. <i>What are the usual causes of Chlorosis?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Chlorosis is caused by torpor and debility of the
whole frame, <i>especially of the womb</i>. It is generally
produced by scanty or by improper food, by the want
of air and exercise, and by too close application within
doors. Here we have the same tale over again—close
application within doors, and the want of fresh air and
exercise! When will the eyes of a mother be opened
to this important subject?—the most important that
can engage her attention!</p>

<p class='c008'>380. <i>What is the usual age for Chlorosis to occur,
and what are the symptoms?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Chlorosis more frequently attacks girls from fifteen
to twenty years of age; although unmarried women,
much older, occasionally have it. I say <i>unmarried</i>,
for, as a rule, it is a complaint of the <i>single</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient, first of all, complains of being languid,
tired, and out of spirits; she is fatigued with the slightest
exertion; she has usually palpitation of the heart
(so as to make her fancy that she has a disease of that
organ, which, in all probability, she has <i>not</i>); she has
shortness of breath, and a short dry cough; her face is
flabby and pale; her complexion gradually assumes a
yellowish or greenish hue—hence the name of chlorosis;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1397'>1397</span>there is a dark, livid circle around her eyes; her lips
lose their color, and become almost white; her tongue
is generally white and pasty; her appetite is bad, and
is frequently depraved—the patient often preferring
chalk, slate-pencil, cinder, and even dirt, to the daintiest
food; indigestion frequently attends chlorosis; she
has usually pains over the short-ribs, on the <i>left</i> side;
she suffers greatly from “wind,” and is frequently
nearly choked by it; her bowels are generally costive,
and the stools are unhealthy; she has pains in her
hips, loins, and back; and her feet and ankles are oftentimes
swollen. <i>The menstrual discharge is either suspended,
or very partially performed</i>; if the latter, it
is usually almost colorless. Hysterical fits not unfrequently
occur during an attack of chlorosis.</p>

<p class='c008'>381. <i>How may Chlorosis be prevented?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>If health were more and fashion were less studied,
chlorosis would not be such a frequent complaint. This
disease generally takes its rise from mismanagement—from
Nature’s laws having been set at defiance. I have
heard a silly mother express an opinion that it is not
<i>genteel</i> for a girl to eat <i>heartily</i>! Such language is
perfectly absurd and cruel. How often, too, a weak
mother declares that a healthy, blooming girl looks like
a milkmaid! It would be well if she did! How true
and sad it is, that “a pale, delicate face, and clear eyes,
indicative of consumption, are the fashionable <i>desiderata</i>
at present for complexion.”<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>A growing girl requires <i>plenty</i> of <i>good</i> nourishment—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1398'>1398</span>much as her appetite demands; and if she have
it not, she will become either chlorotic, or consumptive,
or delicate. Besides, <i>the greatest beautifier in the
world is health</i>; therefore, by a mother studying the
health of her daughter, she will, at the same time,
adorn her body with beauty! I am sorry to say that
too many parents think more of the beauty than of the
health of their girls. Sad and lamentable infatuation!
Nathaniel Hawthorne gives a graphic description of a
delicate young lady. He says: “She is one of those
delicate, nervous young creatures not uncommon in
New England, and whom I suppose to have become
what we find them by the gradually refining away of
the physical system among young women. Some
philosophers choose to glorify this habit of body by
terming it spiritual; but, in my opinion, it is rather
the effect of unwholesome food, bad air, lack of out-door
exercise, and neglect of bathing, on the part of
these damsels and their female progenitors, all resulting
in a kind of hereditary dyspepsia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nathaniel Hawthorne, a distinguished American,
was right. Such ladies, when he wrote, were not uncommon;
but within the last two or three years, to
their great credit be it spoken, “a change has come
o’er the spirit of their dreams,” and they are wonderfully
improved in health; for, with all reverence be it
spoken, “God helps them who help themselves,” and
they have helped themselves by attending to the rules of
health: “The women of America are growing more and
more handsome every year for just this reason. They are
growing rounder of chest, fuller of limb, gaining substance
and development in every direction. Whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1399'>1399</span>may be urged to the contrary, we believe this to be a
demonstrable fact.... When the rising generation
of American girls once begin to wear thick shoes,
to take much exercise in the open air, to skate, to play
croquet, and to affect the saddle, it not only begins to
grow more wise but more healthful, and—which must
follow as the night the day—more beautiful.”<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>If a young girl had plenty of wholesome meat, varied
from day to day, either plain roast or boiled, and
neither stewed, nor hashed, nor highly seasoned, for
her stomach; if she had an abundance of fresh air for
her lungs; if she had plenty of active exercise, such
as skipping, dancing, running, riding, swimming, for
her muscles; if her clothing were warm and loose, and
adapted to the season; if her mind were more occupied
with active, <i>useful</i> occupation, such as household
work, than at present, and if she were kept calm and
untroubled from the hurly-burly and excitement of
fashionable life,—chlorosis would almost be an unknown
disease. It is a complaint of rare occurrence
with country girls, but of great frequency with fine
city ladies.</p>

<p class='c008'>382. <i>What treatment should you advise?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The treatment which would prevent should be
adopted when the complaint first makes its appearance.
If the above means do not quickly remove it,
the mother must then apply to a medical man, and he
will give medicines <i>which will soon have the desired
effect</i>. If the disease be allowed for any length of time
to run on, it might produce either organic—incurable—disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1400'>1400</span>of the heart, or consumption, or indigestion,
or confirmed ill health.</p>

<p class='c008'>383. <i>At what period of life is a lady most prone to
Hysterics, and what are the symptoms?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The time of life when hysterics occur is generally
from the age of fifteen to fifty. Hysterics come on by
paroxysms—hence they are called hysterical fits. A
patient, just before an attack, is low spirited; crying
without a cause; she is “nervous,” as it is called; she
has flushings of the face; she is at other times very
pale; she has shortness of breath and occasional palpitations
of the heart; her appetite is usually bad;
she passes quantities of colorless limpid urine, having
the appearance of pump-water; she is much troubled
with flatulence in her bowels, and, in consequence, she
feels bloated and uncomfortable. The “wind” at length
rises upward toward the stomach, and still upward
to the throat, giving her the sensation of a ball stopping
her breathing, and producing a feeling of suffocation.
The sensation of a ball in the throat (<i>globus
hystericus</i>) is the commencement of the fit.</p>

<p class='c008'>She now becomes <i>partially</i> insensible, although she
seldom loses <i>complete</i> consciousness. Her face becomes
flushed, her nostrils dilated, her head thrown back,
and her stomach and bowels enormously distended
with “wind.” After a short time she throws her arms
and legs about convulsively, she beats her breast, tears
her hair and clothes, laughs boisterously, and screams
violently; at other times she makes a peculiar noise;
sometimes she sobs, and her face is much distorted.
At length she brings up enormous quantities of wind;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1401'>1401</span>after a time, she bursts into a violent flood of tears, and
then gradually comes to herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the fit is at an end she generally passes
enormous quantities of colorless limpid urine. She
might, in a short time, fall into another attack similar
to the above. When she comes to herself she feels
exhausted and tired, and usually complains of slight
headache, and of great soreness of the body and limbs.
She seldom remembers what has occurred during the
fit. Hysterics are sometimes frightful to witness; but,
in themselves, are not at all dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>384. <i>What are the causes of Hysterics?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Delicate health, chlorosis, improper and not sufficiently
nourishing food, grief, anxiety, excitement of
the mind, closely confined rooms, want of exercise,
indigestion, flatulence, and tight lacing are the causes
which usually produce hysterics. Hysterics are frequently
feigned; indeed, oftener than any other complaint;
and even a <i>genuine</i> case is usually much aggravated
by a patient herself giving way to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>385. <i>What do you recommend an Hysterical lady to
do?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>To improve her health by proper management; to
rise early and to take a walk, that she may breathe
pure and wholesome air,—indeed, she ought to live
nearly half her time in the open air, exercising herself
with walking, skipping, etc.; to employ her mind with
botany, croquet, archery, or with any other out-door
amusement; to confine herself to plain, wholesome,
nourishing food; to avoid tight lacing; to eschew
fashionable amusements; and, above all, not to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1402'>1402</span>way to her feelings, but if she feel an attack approaching,
to rouse herself.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>If the fit be upon her</i>, the better plan is to banish
all the <i>male</i> sex from the room, and not even to have
many women about her, and for those around to loosen
her dress; to lay her in the center of the room, flat
upon the ground, with a pillow under her head; to
remove combs and pins and brooches from her person;
to dash cold water upon her face; to apply cloths, or
a large sponge wetted in cold water, to her head; to
throw open the window, and then to leave her to herself;
or, at all events, to leave her with only one
<i>female</i> friend or attendant. If such be done, she will
soon come round; but what is the usual practice? If
a girl be in hysterics, the whole house, and perhaps
the neighborhood, is roused; the room is crowded to
suffocation; fears are openly expressed by those around
that she is in a dangerous state; she hears what they
say, and her hysterics are increased tenfold.</p>

<hr class='c023'>

<p class='c008'>If this book is to be of use to mothers and to the
rising generation, as I humbly hope and trust that it
has been, and that it will be still more abundantly, it
ought not to be listlessly read, merely as a novel, or
as any other piece of fiction, but it must be thoughtfully
and carefully studied, until its contents, in all its
bearings, be completely mastered and understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>In conclusion, I beg to thank you for the courtesy,
confidence, and attention I have received at your hands,
and to express a hope that my advice, through God’s
blessing, may not have been given in vain.</p>

in my other book, <cite>Advice to a Mother</cite>, that I consider it quite
unnecessary to say more in this place on the subject. Moreover,
it is not so necessary now as in the early editions of my
two works to dwell upon the subject, as, I am happy to say,
the evil effects of tight lacing are at the present time better
understood. Stays used to be formidable-looking apparatuses;
indeed, they were instruments of torture. Now they are
more simple, and therefore more suitable.</p>

aptitude for procreation, is usually between the
thirteenth and sixteenth years. It is generally thought to be
somewhat earlier in warm climates than in cold, and in
densely populated manufacturing towns than in thinly populated
agricultural districts. The mental and bodily habits of
the individual have also considerable influence upon the time
of its occurrence; girls brought up in the midst of luxury or

as late in life as at fifty-one, and four at fifty-two; and one
mother was registered as having given birth to a child in the

<p class='c008'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. It is very unusual, in this climate, for a girl to become a
mother until she be seventeen or eighteen years of age. A
case has just occurred, however (1864), where a girl became a
mother before she reached her fourteenth year. In his last
report to the Registrar-General, the registrar for Park district,
Sheffield, says: “I have registered the birth of a child
in my district this quarter, the age of the mother being only
thirteen years and ten months. She was employed in a cotton
mill in the neighborhood of Manchester.”</p>

[womb], appears to be nearly or quite identical with ordinary
blood; but in its passage through the vagina it becomes mixed
with the acid mucus exuded from its walls, which usually deprives
it of the power of coagulating. If the discharge should
be profuse, however, a portion of its fibrin remains unaffected,
and clots are formed.”—<cite>Dr. Carpenter’s Human Physiology.</cite></p>

smile or a blush, that she is <i>enceinte</i>, would do well to remember
the origin of the word she uses. It was the habit of the
Roman ladies to wear a tight girdle or cincture round their
waists; but when pregnancy occurred, they were required by
law—at least that of opinion—to remove this restraint; and
hence a woman so situated was said to be <i>incincta</i>, or unbound,
and hence also the adoption of the term <i>enceinte</i> to signify a
state of pregnancy.”</p>

There are other india-rubber apparatuses

Sometimes they are made with two separate and distinct
india-rubber pipes, the one of which is to be used in the administration
of an enema, and the other either for giving an
injection up the vagina, or for washing out the vagina with
warm water. The best quality of apparatus ought always to

let me tell you of a good way. Let the cook mince <i>very fine</i>—as
fine as sausage-meat—one pound of the shoulder blade of
beef, taking care that every particle of fat be removed; then
let her put the meat either into a saucepan or into a digester
with three pepper corns and a pint and a half of <i>cold</i> water;
let it be put on the fire to boil; let it slowly boil for an hour,
and then let it be strained; and you will have most delicious
beef-tea, light and nourishing, grateful to the stomach and
palate. When cold, carefully skim any remaining fat (if there
be any) from it, and warm it up when wanted. It is always
well, when practicable, to make beef-tea the day before it is
wanted, in order to be able to skim it when quite cold. It
may be served up with a finger or two of dry toast, and with
salt to suit the taste. Sometimes a patient prefers the beef-tea
<i>without</i> the pepper corns; when such be the case, let the
pepper corns be omitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you wish your beef-tea to be particularly strong and
nourishing, and if you have any beef bones in the house, let
them be broken up and slowly boiled in a <i>digester</i> for a couple
of hours, or even longer, with the finely minced-up beef.</p>

that every child should have his own sponge, each of

sensible remarks: “I do not know if a practice common
among French ladies, when they do not nurse, has obtained
the attention among ourselves which it seems to me to deserve.
When the infant is to be fed with cow milk, that from
various cows is submitted to examination by the medical man,
and if possible, tried on some child, and when the milk of any
cow has been chosen, no other milk is ever suffered to enter
the child’s lips, for a French lady would as soon offer to her
infant’s mouth the breasts of half a dozen wet-nurses in the
day, as mix together the milk of various cows, which must
differ even as the animals themselves, in its constituent qualities.
Great attention is also paid to the pasture, or other food
of the cow thus appropriated.”—<cite>December 29, 1860.</cite></p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r168'>168</a>. It may be interesting to a mother to know the average
weight of new-born infants. There is a paper on the subject
in the <cite>Medical Circular</cite> (April 10, 1861), and which has been
abridged in <cite>Braithwaite’s Retrospect of Medicine</cite> (July and December,
1861). The following are extracts: “Dr. E. von
Siebold presents a table of the weights of 3000 infants (1586
male and 1414 female), weighed immediately after birth.
From this table (for which we have not space) it results that
by far the greater number of the children (2215) weighed between
6 and 8 lbs. From 5¾ to 6 lbs. the number rose from
99 to 268; and from 8 to 8¼ lbs. they fell from 226 to 67, and
never rose again at any weight to 100. From 8¾ to 9½ lbs.
they sank from 61 to 8, rising, however, at 9½ lbs to 21. Only
six weighed 10 lbs., one 10¾ lbs., and two 11 lbs. The author
has never but once met with a child weighing 11¾ lbs. The
most frequent weight in the 3000 was 7 lbs., numbering 426. It
is a remarkable fact, that until the weight of 7 lbs. the female
infants exceeded the males in number, the latter thenceforward
predominating.... From these statements, and those of
various other authors here quoted, the conclusion may be
drawn that the normal weight of a mature new-born infant is
not less than 6 nor more than 8 lbs., the average weight being
6½ or 7 lbs., the smaller number referring to female and the
higher to male infants.”</p>

curds? By rennet. What is rennet? The juice of a calf’s
maw or stomach. The moment the milk enters the human
maw or stomach, the juice of the stomach converts it into
curds—into solid food, just as readily as when it enters a calf’s
maw or stomach, and much more readily than by rennet, as
the <i>fresh</i> juice is stronger than the <i>stale</i>. An ignorant mother
often complains that because, when her child is sick, the milk
curdles, that it is a proof that it does not agree with him! If,
at those times, it did <i>not</i> curdle, it would, indeed, prove that
his stomach was in a wretchedly weak state; she would, then,

<p class='c008'><a href='#r232'>232</a>. In the <cite>Times</cite> of September 4, 1863, is the following, copied
from the <cite>Bridgewater Mercury</cite>:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Gross Superstition.</span>—In one of the streets of Taunton
there resides a man and his wife who have the care of a child.
This child was attacked with scarlatina, and to all appearance
death was inevitable. A jury of matrons was, as it were, impaneled,
and, to prevent the child ‘dying hard,’ all the doors
in the house, all the drawers, all the boxes, all the cupboards
were thrown wide open, the keys taken out, and the body of
the child placed under a beam, whereby a sure, certain, and
easy passage into eternity could be secured. Watchers held
their vigils throughout the weary night, and in the morning
the child, to the surprise of all, did not die, and is now gradually
recovering.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These old women—this jury of matrons—stumbled on the
right remedy, “all the doors in the house&#160;... were thrown
wide open,” and thus they thoroughly ventilated the apartment.
What was the consequence? The child who, just
before the opening of the doors, had all the appearances “that
death was inevitable,” as soon as fresh air was let in, showed
symptoms of recovery, “and in the morning the child, to the
surprise of all, did not die, and is now gradually recovering.”
There is nothing wonderful—there is nothing surprising to
my mind—in all this. Ventilation—thorough ventilation—is
the grand remedy for scarlatina! Oh, that there were in
scarlet fever cases a good many such old women’s—such a
“jury of matrons”—remedies! We should not then be horrified,
as we now are, at the fearful records of death, which
the Returns of the Registrar-General disclose!</p>

opinion, one of the most beautiful pieces of poetry in the
English language. It is a perfect gem, and a volume in itself,
so truthful, so exquisite, so full of the most valuable
reflections: for instance—(1) “The little rift within the
lute,”—the little tubercle within the lung, “that by-and-by
will make the music mute, and ever widening slowly silence
all,” and the patient eventually dies of consumption. (2)
The little rent—the little rift of a very minute vessel in the
brain, produces an attack of apoplexy, and the patient dies.
(3) Each and all of us, in one form or another, sooner or
later will have “the little rift within the lute.” But why
give more illustrations? a little reflection will bring numerous
examples to my fair reader’s memory.</p>

breaking it into crumb—pour boiling hot milk upon
it, cover it over, and let it stand for five minutes, then apply
the soaked bread over the gum-boil, letting it rest between
the cheek and the gum.</p>

in the making of both boots and shoes, men and women will
as a matter of course suffer from corns.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has often struck me as singular, when all the professions
and trades are so overstocked, that there should be, as there is
in every large town, such a want of chiropodists (corn-cutters)—of
respectable chiropodists—of men who would charge a
<i>fixed</i> sum for every visit the patient may make; for instance,
to every working-man a shilling, and to every gentleman half
a crown or five shillings for <i>each</i> sitting, and not for <i>each</i> corn
(which latter system is a most unsatisfactory way of doing
business). I am quite sure that if such a plan were adopted,
every town of any size in the kingdom would employ regularly
one chiropodist at least. However we might dislike some few
of the American customs, we may copy them with advantage
in this particular—namely, in having a regular staff of chiropodists
both in civil and in military life.</p>
